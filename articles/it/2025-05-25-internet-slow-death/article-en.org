This post will (I hope not) become a beautiful epitaph to the international
network as we know it…

This network used to unite people. Although I was born at the end of
XX century, I missed the rise and fall of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet][FidoNet]] (it was popular enough
in Russia after the fall of USSR and before the network equipment for coaxial
cable or twisted pair became cheaper. We called it [[https://neolurk.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82][Фидонет]]).

But I was born just in time to meet the 56k modems (I had the Acorp
Sprinter@56K), ICQ, forums (hello, phpBB), XMPP and it's transports,
Bombus[fn:bombus] on my Siemens C75 with 2G Internet access from Tele2 and so
on. So I remembered /the spirit/ of the old Internet that really connected
people.

Things changed a bit after 201x — when the new government agency was
established. It was cringe when they blocked site with Doxygen docs and it was
funny when they blocked =127.0.0.1= and so on.

But things changed a lot after 2022 — when a *lot* of Internet-related
services started to reuse "the best practices" of breaking the connectivity
between people and breaking the /international/ network itself.

Finally, in one day I decided to write this post to document the things that
were happening. That day, I read [[https://mastodon.bsd.cafe/@mudala/114417527646601267][a post]] about the FreeBSD 2025 survey in
Mastodon, tried to open the attached link to the third-party site with the
survey itself, and … failed. Just because that site decided to block all
people with russian IPs. I don't know the intention of this decision,
especially in the year 2025 — in this year, I hope, almost all people
understood /how the things work/ and stopped pursuing the dream that blocking
residental russian IPs could make the world a better place.

Not only I, but a lot of people met the same discrimination before and will
meet it in the future. For example, you can see [[https://mastodon.social/@grishka/111934602844613193][this enormously long thread]],
made by [[https://mastodon.social/@grishka][@grishka@mastodon.social]].

BTW, after this "incident" with the survey, [[https://mas.to/@evgandr/114426048680177117][I decided]] to make a separate post
in my blog with evidence of Internet de-internationalization.

Sad to say, but this post will be constantly updated with newly found evidence
of network "balkanization".

Let's get started. There will be no examples of the "modern" enshittified
websites that constantly spam users with ads, popups and other nonsense. A lot
of people have already written a lot about this, see for example [[https://garry.net/posts/the-death-of-the-web][The Death Of
The Web]] blogpost.

I will write about sites that block access from some region(s) of our
planet. And about sites that block access from everyone not coming from some
region(s). All those made not for some kind of security, but directly to
prohibit people from the "wrong" areas to see their "precious content".

The format is simple: screenshot and a little descriptive text below, if
necessary.

#+CAPTION: OpenCulture is not so open — it blocks access from russian IPs with obscure message
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 80% :alt Error 405, access denied at the openculture.com
[[file:2025-04-30-openculture.com.png]]

#+CAPTION: World-wide surveys, but … if you a russian, you can't participate
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 80% :alt Error 403, geo block russia on the surveymonkey.com
[[file:2025-04-30-surveymonkey.com.png]]

#+CAPTION: Wanna download drivers for an old Intel GMA X3100? How about NO?
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 80% :alt Opening any useful links from intel.com are prohibited just because you are in the "wrong country"
[[file:2025-05-02-intel.com.png]]

Translation of the text on the previous screenshot:

#+begin_quote
We immediately suspended all business operations in Russia. This follows our
previous decision to suspend all deliveries to customers in Russia and
Belarus.
#+end_quote

#+CAPTION: Can't view the item page from the outer world. Funny, but the main page opens without problems from the same IP.
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 80% :alt Access restricted if you try to open page from outside
[[file:2025-05-12-ozon.ru.png]]

Translation:

#+begin_quote
Access is restricted. To solve the problem try this:
- Wait and reload the page
- Disable VPN
- Update browser or mobile app
- Connect to the another WiFi or mobile network
- Restart a router
#+end_quote

Obviously, none of these items are helpful.

#+CAPTION: One of the biggest online retailers [ru] won't open from the outer world
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :width 80% :alt "403 Forbidden" error when opening lamoda.ru from the outer world
[[file:2025-05-21-lamoda.ru.png]]

#+CAPTION: DeviantArt returns 403 error if you connect through some sort of secure tunnel via the datacenter, not from residental IP (exposing yourself to the ISP, at least)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :widht 80% :alt "403 Error" when opening deviantart.com through VPN
