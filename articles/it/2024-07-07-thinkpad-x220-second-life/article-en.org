Lenovo Thinkpad X220 is one of my favorite laptop models (the other one is
Panasonic Toughbook CF-19). It has a beautiful seven-row keyboard with space
for all the necessary buttons — there are even separate buttons for =Home=, =End=,
=Pause=[fn:pause] and =Insert=! Rugged magnesium alloy case covered with some kind
of rubber for better grip. A memorable appearance — an angular black rectangle
that looks austere and at the same time quite retro-futuristic. And relatively
powerful hardware, which can be used to this day.

Ah, if it was made not by Lenovo but by IBM; had a keyboard and modularity
like the [[https://chaos.social/@xtaran/112084915245772102][IBM Thinkpad 760XD]], and a mechanical keyboard; and a trackball like
the one on the Thinkpad 220 — it would be priceless!

The Thinkpad X220 has appealed to me since my university days. Unfortunately,
in those old days such a laptop for an unemployed student was not much
different in price from a Boeing wing. But the years went by and at one point
I was able to treat myself and bought this laptop, with that canonical
keyboard with blue Enter, to close the gestalt, so to speak.

Thankfully, at 2019, the prices for a used Thinkpad X220 are no longer the
barrier and I found a used laptop from Europe quite quickly for about 19000
rubles (about $300). It was a machine with a 2.7 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7,
8 Gb of RAM and with an SSD. Fortunately, its previous owner was careful and
the laptop had only a few light spots on the display[fn:ips_problem] from
accidental bumps and microscopic scuffs on the corners of the lid.

Perfect things don't exist in this world — otherwise this article wouldn't
have appeared and engineers would have died of boredom. I've been using my
laptop in 4 years and I've encountered a number of inconveniences:
- The aforementioned smudges on the screen. This is cured, obviously, by
  replacing the display with a new one.
- The screen resolution is 1366x768 — it's *hard* to process photos on it
  because you can see the pixels! At the same time, I've seen people calmly
  processing photos on a MacBook with a slightly larger screen diagonal —
  because it has a resolution of 2560×1600 and the photos look clear enough.
- Whitelist in the BIOS — prevents you from plugging in "non manufacturer
  approved" WiFi cards and other internal peripherals that may be even better
  than what was "approved".
- The keyboard has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_and_American_keyboards][United Kingdom layout]], whereas I'm used to the United
  States one.

And, of course, I couldn't rest a thorn in the side. Modifying a laptop, so
popular among techies, is like installing mods on Skyrim — you can always add
something interesting.

In today's boring world, when in response to the above challenges most people
just shrug their shoulders and buy a new laptop, shaped like a flat bar of
soap and indistinguishable from its counterparts on the store shelf — all with
the same glossy screen, the same non-removable battery, a flat island keyboard
that doesn't give a pleasant typing experience, and a MacBook-like touchpad —
someone has to keep doing fun things, right?

* Installing a new 2K screen

Of course, I started with the thing that bothered me the most — the display. I
wanted my X220 to have a matte display with a resolution like a MacBook's
display. Matte screen will not glare and fingerprints on it will be less
noticeable. Before, I had Asus F6E with glossy display — all reflections from
windows, ceiling lamps and other light sources were mine. But when you get
used to it — it seems as if everything is comfortable and there are no
problems: "just turn the brightness up a bit more now and that's it" 🤡.

I knew that someone [[https://nitrocaster.me/store/x220-x230-fhd-mod-kit.html][nitrocaster]] made HD mod for Thinkpad X220 — but it is now
out of stock in his store. Also, some Chinese guy made motherboards for X220
case with modern hardware and 30-pin LVDS connector, which is suitable for
connecting modern displays without a soldering iron. But, as I read on Reddit,
he got tired and temporarily stopped taking orders.

Luckily, I found on the AliExpress [[https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005004222503527.html][Thinkpad expansion boards]] that add a FHD,
2K or 4K screen support. The installation instructions for these boards are no
better than Chinese datasheets for electronic components translated to
Russian. But that didn't stop me — I immediately bought a 2K-modification
board, a cable for the display and the display itself (from another
seller). Lucky, focusing solely on reviews of the kind: "I bought this display
for the 2K modification of my ThinkPad, everything works, thank you" — I'm
find the Sharp LQ125T1JW02 display that suited me.

Due to the lack of good documentation, I had to look at the Chinese manual
with one eye, the [[https://nitrocaster.me/files/x220.x230_fhd_mod_rev5_v0.2.pdf][nitrocaster PDF]] with the other, and use the common sense and
university skills with the third eye.

The easiest part is disassembling the laptop — it can be disassembled almost
blindly, using only a screwdriver and [[https://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/0a60739_04.pdf][a manual]]. And then comes the most
interesting part...

I removed resistor R318 and soldered /one/ copper wire each to capacitors C137
and C584 — these wires will be soldered to the modification board later. It
turned out that it is *very important* to use only one thin wire — even several
wires soldered together will easily tear off the contact pad along with the
capacitor itself. In my first attempt to modify the X220, this is exactly what
happened — and I had the need to solder *only one* wire to the via hole where
the track from the C137 capacitor went:

#+CAPTION: Torn off capacitor and soldering to the via hole
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt soldered via
[[file:soldered_via.jpg]]

Fortunately, this capacitor was not really needed, because the track from it
went to the Display Port connector of the docking station, whose lines are
already occupied by the 2K modification board:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Dock-station Display Port schematics
[[file:dock_dp_schematic.jpg]]

Next I begin to work with the Chinese board. My board required a little
treatment with a file and wire cutters, because it was carelessly bitten out
of the board panel after etching the tracks. I also soldered two contact pads
(marked with arrows on the photo), where the wires, described above, will be
soldered:

#+CAPTION: Chinese 2K modification board for Thinkpad X220
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt preparing 2k mod board
[[file:2K_mod_board.jpg]]

After that I carefully installed the expansion board onto the motherboard,
checking that the pins from the dock connector fall into the correct holes:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt docking interface contacts
[[file:dock_interface_contacts.jpg]]

And began to solder. It's easy to understand what exactly to solder — the
corresponding holes have gold plating. For the small round holes, I had to use
the thinnest and sharpest soldering tip to reach the pins of the dock
connector and heat the solder around them.

Since 2011, because everyone who manufactures consumer electronics had already
switched to lead-free solder — naturally nothing heated up and soldered. I had
to increase the temperature of the soldering iron a little and add normal,
i.e. lead solder to the soldering points so that the tin began to melt. Only
after that I got something. Of course, I used a flux suitable for
microelectronics (not rosin and not acidic) — without it nothing would have
worked at all.

#+CAPTION: Soldered 2K-modification board
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt 2k mod soldered
[[file:soldered_2k_board.jpg]]

As you can see, here I peeled the film from the soldering area, soldered the
2K mod board, and then covered everything with the film again, cutting a
window for the LVDS connector. This way, accidentally spilled water will not
get on any of the boards and will easily go down the drain, as IBM engineers
intended.

#+CAPTION: 2K-modification board installed and covered with protective film
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt 2k mod covered
[[file:covered_2k_board.jpg]]

Of course, the 2K screen didn't work the first time. At first the external
display didn't even turn on and was absent in the =xrandr= output. But after I
tapped the expansion board with a plastic stick it suddenly appeared in the
utility output. Further tapping on the board caused the image on the new
display to blink and show multicolored stripes — like with a damaged video
cable. Since "electronics is the science of contacts" — it's obvious that one
of the tiny round holes didn't connect to the connector's pin on the
motherboard. Or perhaps the soldering was bad and cracked from the impacts. I
had to disconnect the motherboard from the peripherals again and solder the 2K
mod board once more. In the process, it turned out that the soldering iron
wasn't hot enough the first time — sometimes it stuck to the tin of the newly
soldered hole — but I didn't pay attention to that the first time.

After re-soldering the contacts, the new display worked immediately and did
not respond in any way to tapping on the expansion board:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt 2k display working
[[file:2K_display.jpg]]

However, multicolored stripes on the screen are not the only sign of contacts
problems. I've had the new display sometimes not turn on and was recognized by
=xrandr= as having a resolution of 640x480. Also, after turning off both
displays to save power — the main display would turn on, but the new one would
only turn on the backlight, but no image would appear. All these problems were
also solved by re-soldering the round contacts on the expansion board.

But my adventures with a soldering iron didn't end there — I accidentally
burned the motherboard...

For the first time in all the time I had this laptop, I installed Windows on
it. After such a sacrilege[fn:1st_mb_fail] it froze intentionally — so much so
that it didn't even respond to a long press of the power button. I rashly
removed the battery from the working laptop — and then it didn't even turn on,
just blinking once with the power button and that's all...

If I left the board to lie on the workbench for half a day so that the
electronic gnomes could rest without voltage connected, it still turned
on. But for about half an hour, after which the symptoms of freezing were
repeated, alas, in any operating system. In my attempts to fix everything, I
reached the power control chip for laptops (=U59=) — I managed to check that all
power lines approaching this chip really supply the power — 3.3V, 5V, 17V, and
20V.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt U59 microchip
[[file:u59.jpg]]

There will be no happy end. When I started to check what's on the signal
inputs, my hand shook and the 17V power line was shorted to one of the signal
lines. After that, something burned out either in the circuitry coming from
the charging/external power connector or somewhere around the 3.3/5V DC-DC
converters. It was already the seventh day of digging into the non-working
board (at first I thought that the problem was in the BIOS and experimented
with it), all this bored me a lot — and I just did as per Lenovo service
manual — threw the broken board in the corner and put a known working board on
the place. I was lucky to find an original working board with Core i7 on Avito
(Russian analog of OLX), from a person who was selling his old laptop.

Since my hand was already trained, I soldered everything on the second
motherboard without regaining consciousness and the 2K modification worked
from the first time. So I can say that this is not the most difficult stage of
laptop modification, the main thing is not to hurry and solder carefully.

** Flashing the coreboot

Unfortunately, the new display didn't work in BIOS or GRUB — only in Linux:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt 2k display doesn't show bios
[[file:no_bios.jpg]]

Setting =Config->Display= in the BIOS didn't help, and the Chinese vendor had a
huge delay in answering questions, so I had to manage on my own. I noticed
that the display turns on when Linux switches the output mode from text to
framebuffer. And assumed that if the BIOS also did the same switching, the
problem would be solved.

Of course, the official BIOS can't do that. But in half of the stories about
Thinkpad X220 modding I've seen mention of coreboot. And just now, in the wiki
of this project there was a mention of some libgfxinit, which can set another
video mode besides text mode.

Fortunately, flashing coreboot turned out to be much easier than flashing the
original BIOS. In the case of the latter, you need to find Windows somewhere,
install it on the laptop or make a bootable flash drive (=dd= will not help
here), connect the battery, and make sure it is charged — otherwise the
finicky BIOS update program will refuse to do anything.

#+CAPTION: Updating BIOS on the ThinkPad
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Flashing original BIOS
[[file:flashing_original_bios.jpg]]

And for coreboot, you only need the following:
- Physical access to the BIOS chip (in the lower left corner of the board,
  next to the PCI-Express card enclosure)
- A programmer for flash memory chips with SPI interface, e.g. CH341.

#+CAPTION: According to the labeling, I have a Macronix MX25L6406E chip
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt BIOS chip
[[file:bios_chip.jpg]]

The procedure of coreboot flashing is as simple as possible and familiar to
the embedded systems developers — the board is disconnected from power supply
and peripherals and a binary with firmware is written into it from a computer
via a programmer. All this is done through =flashrom= utility, which doesn't
care has laptop the connected battery, how charged it is and what phase of the
moon it is.

The first time I used a clip for the SOP-8 case — all the guides recommended
using it "for convenience" so you didn't have to solder anything:

#+CAPTION: Clip, connected to the flash-memory chip
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Connected CH341 programmer
[[file:connected_ch341.jpg]]

But with all that advices: "how to do everything without a soldering iron" —
it turned out to be a road to hell. The second motherboard had a Winbond
W25Q64CV chip installed — which, judging by reports from people who also tried
to upload coreboot to it, is very demanding to the quality of signal lines,
unlike the Macronix chip. It requires the shortest possible lines of the same
length and reliable contact with the chip legs — so, in the end, I still had
to solder to the flash memory chip. Fortunately, all I had to do was to solder
to the SPI legs and to the chip power supply.

#+CAPTION: Programmer cable soldered to the chip
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Connected CH341 programmer
[[file:connected_ch341_2.jpg]]

With a 30-centimeter wires from the clip, I read incomprehensible things from
the chip from Winbond, and the writing most often ended with errors. Exactly
so, the original BIOS from motherboard #2 was lost forever... I was "lucky"
enough that in two readings of the dump from the chip — the misread bits were
in the same places.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cd bios/
$ sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r bios_thinkpad_x220_original.rom -V
$ sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r 02.rom -V
$ md5sum *.rom
8e7e07cf8cf2f1e8df5fe66cfd92dcb8  02.rom
8e7e07cf8cf2f1e8df5fe66cfd92dcb8  bios_thinkpad_x220_original.rom
#+END_EXAMPLE

Apparently, this is why after connecting the programmer, it is advised to read
the contents of the chip for comparsion at least three times, not two.

My further actions were based on these posts: [[https://szclsya.me/posts/coreboot/x220/][one]] and [[https://brycevandegrift.xyz/blog/corebooting-a-thinkpad-x220/][two]]. After a few days of
experimenting with the first board, before it burned out, I found out the
following:
- coreboot with Legacy video initialization and no Video BIOS does not display
  on the second (2K) monitor.
- coreboot with Legacy video initialization and with Video BIOS, which I
  downloaded from the person who built coreboot for Thinkpad X220 — gives
  green squares on the main display, the second display does not work in
  principle. After the green squares coreboot hangs intentionally.
- coreboot with libgfxinit — not shown on the second display. Also, it does
  not support booting the OS in text mode. For example, instead of the FreeBSD
  text installer, you can see a narrow bar with something like video
  interference[fn:freebsd_coreboot_fix] at the top of the screen.
  #+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt freebsd livecd and corebootfb
  [[file:freebsd_n_corebootfb.jpg]]
- Chinese BIOS, which is downgraded to 1.44 and patched with special Chinese
  patches just for my 2K modification board — also doesn't display on the
  second monitor.

After that I crawled into the coreboot sources, where I quickly found out the
following:
1. The DP3 video output to which my 2K monitor is connected via the expansion
   board is described in both coreboot source code and libgfxinit source code.
2. If I change the Ada code for libgfxinit to initialize DP3 at startup
   instead of system LVDS — my 2K display still shows nothing.
3. If I download the datasheet for the display, write in the coreboot code the
   necessary timings in the video initialization code for Lenovo X220 platform
   and initialize DP3 at startup in legacy video mode — the display still
   doesn't show anything.

Here I either lacked understanding of the Ada language or documentation about
initialization of the built-in Intel GMA 3000 video core on my CPU
("thankfully" user documentation from Intel for this not the latest video core
can now be downloaded only in the darknet 🤡🤡🤡). In the end my
high-definition display still started only inside the OS.

However, the point of corebooting the Thinkpad X220 was still there. First of
all, I, as user, needed from the BIOS only two things:
- be able to run the boot loader from the hard disk
- swap the Ctrl and Fn keys — for me Ctrl is *necessarily* the lower left key on
  the keyboard.

Second, coreboot started up an order of magnitude faster than the original
BIOS. Even despite the added pause of two seconds to allow me to select
another disk for booting. In a situation when your display starts showing
something only at the moment of OS booting, you want to skip the BIOS boot and
the OS loader as fast as possible.

Preparing to build coreboot is quite simple with just one command that saws
the original BIOS dump into binary, proprietary blobs and disables Intel ME:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recursive https://review.coreboot.org/coreboot.git && \
    git clone https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner.git && \
    cd coreboot/util/ifdtool && make && sudo make install && \
    cd ../../../bios && \
    python ../me_cleaner/me_cleaner.py -s bios_thinkpad_x220_original.rom -O working_copy.rom && \
    ifdtool -x working_copy.rom && \
    mkdir -p ../coreboot/3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/lenovo/x220/ && \
    mv flashregion_0_flashdescriptor.bin ../coreboot/3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/lenovo/x220/descriptor.bin && \
    mv flashregion_2_intel_me.bin ../coreboot/3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/lenovo/x220/me.bin && \
    mv flashregion_3_gbe.bin ../coreboot/3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/lenovo/x220/gbe.bin && \
    rm flashregion*.bin working_copy.rom
#+end_SRC

Fortunately, I was lucky, and despite the fact that the original BIOS from the
second motherboard was read with errors due to the use of clip and later,
after the first reflashing to coreboot, was lost irretrievably — the required
areas in the received binary were not affected.

I configured coreboot under ThinkPad X220 as follows:

#+begin_example
CONFIG_VENDOR_LENOVO=y
CONFIG_LINEAR_FRAMEBUFFER_MAX_HEIGHT=768
CONFIG_LINEAR_FRAMEBUFFER_MAX_WIDTH=1366
CONFIG_CONSOLE_POST=y
CONFIG_SEABIOS_PS2_TIMEOUT=3000
CONFIG_HAVE_IFD_BIN=y
CONFIG_BOARD_LENOVO_X220=y
CONFIG_PCIEXP_L1_SUB_STATE=y
CONFIG_PCIEXP_CLK_PM=y
CONFIG_H8_SUPPORT_BT_ON_WIFI=y
CONFIG_H8_FN_CTRL_SWAP=y
CONFIG_HAVE_ME_BIN=y
CONFIG_CHECK_ME=y
CONFIG_HAVE_GBE_BIN=y
CONFIG_GENERIC_LINEAR_FRAMEBUFFER=y
CONFIG_DRIVERS_PS2_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_COREINFO_SECONDARY_PAYLOAD=y
CONFIG_MEMTEST_SECONDARY_PAYLOAD=y
#+end_example

And flashed the resulting binary into the motherboard #2. And then, *suddenly*,
the time of miracles began! For some reason coreboot was displayed on 2K
display! I already used the same coreboot configuration on the first board and
there something was shown only on the original display. Moreover, in the
reviews on AliExpress one person also wrote that coreboot was not displayed on
the 2K screen.

Also, [[https://mail.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2017-January/082956.html][in the coreboot mailing list]] I saw a person with a similar problem. And
the only solution he was given was to either disassemble and patch the
original Video BIOS so that it outputs video to the right interface instead of
LVDS. Or switch to libgfxinit and edit its source code so that the right video
output is used at system startup.

Why everything suddenly worked on the second motherboard, which differs from
the first one only by the brand of the Flash-memory chip for BIOS, and without
any edits in the coreboot source code — I don't know 🤷‍♂️.

Probably, since the response to the above-mentioned letter in the mailing
list, the libgfxinit developer has already managed to implement graphical
output to all interfaces available on the board. And nothing worked with my
motherboard #1 because of the same thing that eventually caused it to
die. Maybe when rebuilding coreboot from scratch again, I enabled a couple
options that I didn't seem to have before. To figure out what happened — I
need a bit more equipment than I have now, and a few more motherboards and
2K-modification boards to test. I'm certainly not ready to test my hypotheses
on the only (out of two) working boards.

** Installing the new display

What remains is ... to install the display in its rightful place.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center
[[file:monitor.jpg]]

First, I disassembled the original display module according to the service
manual[fn:display_module_disassemble] and took everything unnecessary out of
there:

- Video cable to the old display (goes through the left hinge)
- The old display itself
- Wires to the antennas from the WWAN-module — blue and red (why I removed
  them — I wrote below, in the section about WiFi-module).
- The wire to the antenna from the WiFi card — black wire.

Also I took off the WWAN antennas and the one WiFi antenna, because we won't
need them where we're going.

#+CAPTION: Peeling off unwanted WiFi antennas
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt WiFi antenna in the display case
[[file:dismantle_wifi_antenna.jpeg]]

I ended up with this:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Disassembled laptop lid
[[file:notebook_lid.jpg]]

The left hinge will carry the video cable for the new display. The right hinge
will still be used for the camera and LED-board cables, along with the cable
for the last remaining WiFi antenna.

In order to fit the new display in here, I did a little bit of
locksmithing. The bottom of my 2K display is a bit wider than the original one
and to fit everything inside the laptop lid, I have to cut off the metal
guides near the hinges.

#+CAPTION: These guides, next to both hinges, need to be cut off
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt what to mill
[[file:lid_parts2mill.jpg]]

All I had was a Dremel, metal cutting disks and abrasive sanding bits. That
was enough to remove the unwanted guides. But if you happen to have a milling
machine, it's easier to use it! I hear that the result will be even better and
more beautiful.

#+CAPTION: Cutted guides
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt milled parts on the lid
[[file:lid_parts_milled.jpg]]

Also, the display frame needed a little tweaking with a file — I had to remove
the plastic near the hinges a bit so that it wouldn't rest on the new
display. I also bit off a couple of the plastic latches, the mating pieces for
which were just cut with a Dremel.

The new display itself, alas, didn't have any attachment points. It was just a
flat thin rectangle, arrived with a couple of strips of double-sided
tape. Naturally, I wasn't going to be like /modern/ laptop manufacturers and
glue the display into the lid, so that I would have to go through all sorts of
pain when I needed to remove it — and I would have to remove it for almost any
actions with the antenna, camera, keyboard light, etc.

And then my eyes fell on the removed original display — because it "lies" in
such a convenient metal frame, which already has lugs with holes for screws
that screw into the lid of the laptop:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt metal case for original display
[[file:back_of_original_display.jpg]]

In addition, this frame made it easy to set the desired height of the new
display inside the cover — its face should be flush with the lugs, similar to
the original display:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt old display height
[[file:old_display_height.jpg]]

The old display was immediately disassembled into useful components — a metal
frame, from which were sawn off the mounts at the bottom for the control board
of the original display and the U-shaped bend in the bottom "bar". And on a
piece of clear plastic, which perfectly complemented the height of the new
display. All this was glued together with transparent glue and double-sided
tape — and as a result, a new 2K display module was born. It can be removed
with just a Phillips screwdriver, without a soldering dryer and unnecessary
suffering.

#+CAPTION: Mount for 2K display

[[file:case_for_new_display.jpg]]

#+CAPTION: New display installed
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt new 2K display
[[file:new_display.jpg]]

The final touch was left. I tore off the Lenovo logo from the lid and filled
the recess under it with epoxy. It's not so easy with the logo under the
display — the white paint is all over the plastic in the frame and you can't
tear off or sand the logo — you can only glue it on. After that, I ordered
stickers with the IBM logo on matte paper from a printing house, cut them with
a knife to the size I needed and glued them where necessary:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt IBM logos
[[file:logos.webp]]

Obviously, after all of Lenovo's "innovations" — when they destroyed the
beautiful 7-row keyboard, removed the separate trackpoint buttons for some
ThinkPad models, removed the ability to hook a docking station and battery
from the bottom of the laptop — that is, they diligently turn the Thinkpad
into a regular laptop "like everyone else's", justifying it with "the future",
"innovations" and the fact that old Thinkpad fans should adapt (🤡) — I don't
really like them.

** New display and FreeBSD

Naturally, the new expansion board and the new display required certain
changes in the software as well. First, I adjusted the DPI according [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI#X_Resources][to the
instructions]] ([[https://github.com/eugeneandrienko/dotfiles/commit/67ae822f43067ce12f8a928c7b89935f973b7fb5][like this]]) so that I could work on the laptop without a
magnifying glass.

To avoid typing =vbe on= in the bootloader every time and to see the FreeBSD's
boot log on the new display instead of a narrow strip of “video noise” at the
top of the screen, I added a couple lines to =/boot/loader.conf=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
hw.vga.textmode="0"
vbe_max_resolution=2560x1440
#+END_EXAMPLE

To disable LVDS output at X-server startup — I used standard utilities =xrandr=
and =backlight=:

#+begin_src bash
xrandr --output LVDS-1 --off
xrandr --output DP-3 --primary
backlight 0
#+end_src

To change the brightness using the standard buttons on the Thinkpad keyboard,
I had to dig into the system a bit more. The Chinese manufacturer made a very
intricate brightness adjustment for the new display — a short press on the
power button cyclically changes the brightness from minimum to maximum and
back again. Drivers, which return /normal/ brightness adjustment by buttons on
the keyboard — there are only under Windows and they work only with Chinese,
patched BIOS. In Linux and *BSD I'll have to do it myself (I can't turn to
ChatGPT for advice about /that/ problem 😄...).

At first I had to wade through tons of silly advices from forums, where users
suggested to adjust the brightness of external (relative to LVDS in the
laptop) displays via =xbacklight=, =xgamma=, =redshift= and other utilities that
simply change the color gamma and do not touch the actual physical
backlight... Such "changing" the brightness will not affect the battery drain
rate of the laptop.

Then I found this very useful thread on the Thinkpad owners forum: [[https://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=125030][x220 x230
FHD WQHD 2K mSATA USB3.0]] (for some reason they blocked access for users from
the Russian Federation 🤡, so the link won't open just like that). The
contents of this thread pushed me in the direction of digging into the USB
interface used by the 2K-modification board. Unfortunately, by this time I had
already assembled the laptop and really didn't want to disassemble it back, so
I didn't have access to the soldered 2K-modification board in order to test
the =CN15= connector lines going to the docking station.

But, I had something better — a photo of the docking port pins with the
expansion board soldered to them! I also had a burned-out motherboard #1 and a
schematic diagram of the laptop. At first glance it seems that there is
nothing to catch here:

#+CAPTION: CN15 connector to the docking station
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt photo and schematic of CN15
[[file:cn15.png]]

And then I remember that I look at the board from the back side. I mirror the
drawing — and something similar to the truth already emerges:

#+CAPTION: Mirrored CN15 connector
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt photo and schematic of CN15
[[file:cn15-mirrored.png]]

In the end, I was able to easily match the legs of the actual interface and
its symbol on the wiring diagram:

[[file:cn15-correspondence1.png]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt photo and schematic of CN15
[[file:cn15-correspondence2.png]]

Now, from the picture of the 2K-expansion board, I can understand which =CN15=
lines the expansion board uses:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt CN15 lines for 2K mod
[[file:2K_board_lines.jpg]]

Interesting lines:
- Display Port I2C interface lines to the 2K monitor: =DOCKB_DP_DDC_DATA=,
  =DOCKB_DP_DDC_CLK=.
- The lines from the USB interface to the 2K modification board: =USBP8-= и
  =USBP8+=. The other end goes to the Platform Controller Hub (PCH, =U14=).

There were some interesting lines in the =sudo usbconfig list= output:
#+begin_example
ugen0.2: <vendor 0x8087 product 0x0024> at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=HIGH (480Mbps) pwr=SAVE (0mA)

ugen2.3: <vendor 0x8087 product 0x0a2b> at usbus2, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=FULL (12Mbps) pwr=ON (100mA)
#+end_example

The first two lines and the last one turned out to be devices from Intel (see
[[http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids][link]]):
#+begin_example
8087  Intel Corp.
    0020  Integrated Rate Matching Hub
    0024  Integrated Rate Matching Hub
    0a2b  Bluetooth wireless interface
#+end_example

But a search by =AGAN X230= words led to a Taiwanese guy's [[https://github.com/xy-tech/agan_brightness_X230_X330][GitHub repository]] and
then to [[https://www.xyte.ch/mods/x230/][his site]] with detailed information about modifying Thinkpads. From
there I learned more details about my 2K mod — it turns out that it was
originally made by a Chinese modder 阿甘, known to the world as /a.gain/. And
from the GitHub repository it became clear that I am on the right way and the
brightness of the 2K display can be changed via the USB interface of the
board.

Unfortunately, the code from the aforementioned repository was not perfect, so
I wrote my program with one eye peeking at the
=xy-tech/agan_brightness_X230_X330= repository. What is inside my program:
- Clean C code.
- Parsing command line options via libpopt (rather than manually via =atoi=;
  also the nice =--help= output is automatically generated).
- Autotools build.
- Man page.
- A rule for devd so that the utility can be used without elevating privileges
  to =root=.

The program is written for FreeBSD, but probably, if you have [[https://github.com/libusb/hidapi][libusbhid]]
library and its header files installed, it will work under Linux as
well. However, instead of a rule for devd you will have to invent something of
your own.

I tested it only under FreeBSD 14 — everything works on my machine 😊. The
source code can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/eugeneandrienko/brightness_x220_agan2k, the manual is also
there.

* Replacing the WiFi module

After that there was nothing to stop me. Having replaced the original BIOS
with coreboot, I realized that I could plug any suitable peripheral inside my
laptop without having to deal with whitelist.

I started with WiFi. The Thinkpad X220 originally had a 2.4 GHz card with 300
Mbps speed (802.11b/g/n). Fortunately, after getting rid of the whitelist (and
the original BIOS) I can install [[https://aliexpress.ru/item/32853420688.html][a completely different WiFi module]]
(TL-8260D2W) — with support for 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, with speed of about
800-900 Mbps and with support of 802.11b/g/n/ac standards. The main thing is
to close with tape 51 pin, otherwise the built-in Bluetooth will not work.

Since a separate Bluetooth daughter card[fn:bdc] is no longer needed in the
laptop, I removed it and put [[https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005002489857902.html][a BDC to USB adapter]] into the vacated slot.
And as a result I got another USB slot inside the laptop to which I can
connect something. What exactly — I haven't thought of it yet. I don't need
two WiFi modules, plugging in a flash drive is too boring, and a GPS-dongle
won't fit inside the whole case.

#+CAPTION: Internal USB connector
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt USB instead of Bluetooth
[[file:bdc2usb.jpg]]

To the left of the WiFi module I had a WWAN module installed. I wasn't going
to install a SIM card for it, so this module was also removed, and its
antennas were dismantled. Instead of it I installed a half-terabyte SSD with
mSATA interface.

Also, I removed one of the antennas for the WiFi module. This antenna will be
replaced with an external antenna. Although I don't do any pentesting and I
don't care much about the range of my laptop WiFi — but a laptop with an
external antenna will look awesome!

There is a place for the external antenna's connector right next to the
Kensington-lock:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt place for wifi connector
[[file:kensington_lock.jpg]]

There is a screw next to the intended hole, but if you drill according to the
drawing, that screw will not be in the way:

#+CAPTION: Drawing of the hole (⌀ 6 mm) for the RP-SMA connector
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt external connector drawing
[[file:external_connector_drw_en.jpg]]

A jumper inside the housing was milled to allow the connector to be inserted
into the hole:

#+CAPTION: Drilled hole and milled jumper inside the housing
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Drilled hole
[[file:drilled_hole_wifi.jpeg]]

With a Dremel and a tremor, I didn't get a very neat result. But everything
will be covered with cables anyway, so I just grounded off all the sharp
corners with a file and insulated the exposed metal just in case.

And then I managed to find an external antenna for 2.4 and 5 GHz in Thinkpad
colors and an 18 cm pigtail with RP-SMA on one side and U.FL-connector on the
other side.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt External WiFi connector
[[file:wifi_connector2.jpg]]

The only tricky part here is to route the cables correctly after they come out
from under the keyboard bezel. Otherwise, the palmrest will not snap all the
way in and will get in the way of the cable in the water drainage channel.

#+CAPTION: Here the cables are not yet laid out properly
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt WiFi cables
[[file:wifi_cables.jpg]]

The WiFi card itself and the builtin Bluetooth work like clockwork — at least
in Linux I didn't have to configure anything for it. In FreeBSD I only had to
install a wifibox. Unfortunately, the 802.11ac support for Intel 8260 in
FreeBSD's iwlwifi has not been released yet, so the new card is not fully
exposed it's features and I was forced to use wifibox.

* Replacing the keyboard

Originally, my laptop had a keyboard with a UK[fn:kbd_layouts] layout, which I
really dislike — I've always used keyboards with an US layout. Having to
constantly hit Enter with your finger when you want to enter a pipe character
is annoying.

Luckily the China manufactures still make keyboards for the X220 with pyramid
keys and a seventh row, otherwise this world would be maximally cursed. No
seriously, just read [[https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2022/02/07/epitaph-to-laptops/][this article]] or take a look at this hell:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt cursed keyboards
[[file:cursed_kbd.webp]]

While teens are writing on the keyboards from the photo above all sorts of
cringe about trackpoints in the vein of [[https://twitter.com/erhannah/status/1387447191506198528]["did anyone ever actually use this
thing?"]] — the rest of progressive humanity, who use ThinkPads for more than
just +Twitter+ X shitposting, are gaining *invaluable* experience in clit mouse
usage!

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt clit mouse meme
[[file:clitmouse.png]]

Unfortunately, the Chinese keyboard for the X220 had one fatal flaw. It's
simply of poor quality:
1. The plastic is not as thick and shiny as on older keyboards. To the touch,
   something else is used there — accordingly, the typing sensation will not
   be the same.
2. Instead of the original trackpoint like a lump, a flat trackpoint is used.
3. The characters on the =Enter=, =Backspace= and =Shift= keys are duplicated with
   text for some reason.
4. Instead of calm blue color for icons of special functions, a brighter blue color is used.
5. The power button is also mocked — instead of soft green light a bright
   green LED hits your eyes (thanks God it's not a super-bright blue LED).
6. My copy in general was not notable for its quality — several buttons from
   the top row of the keyboard were hard to press, the metal cover on the back
   of the keyboard was bent.

Fortunately, I was lucky enough to find an original keyboard from a laptop
with a UK layout. Here is a photo for comparison (original keyboard at the
bottom, Chinese keyboard at the top):

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt original and chinese keyboards
[[file:kbd_comp.jpg]]

There's not much to write about the keyboard replacement itself — you simply
remove the old keyboard and install the new one.

I also really wanted to swap the Ctrl and Fn keys on the new keyboard. They
were already swapped in coreboot, but the inscriptions on the keys themselves
kept me busy. Quite quickly it turned out that in ten years no one had ever
produced the necessary keycaps for the original seven-row keyboard. I had to
do it myself.

Luckily, the Fn key is the same size as the right Ctrl key, so it's easy [[https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Lenovo+Thinkpad+X220+Individual+Keys+Replacement/56264][to
remove]] the right Ctrl key from the old keyboard and put it in place of the
left Fn key on the new one. This trick will not work with the left Ctrl, so I
removed the key and manually polished the inscription on it. At the same time,
I did the same with the Super key, on which the Windows logo was drawn for
some reason.

* Laptop power

Here I started by replacing the charger. In principle, the original charger is
excellent in its reliability and unbreakability and there is no need to change
it for something else. But I just came across GaN chargers and batteries with
support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#USB_Power_Delivery][USB Power Delivery protocol]], as well as a [[https://aliexpress.ru/item/4001268721004.html][special cable]] for
charging ThinkPads...

This cable has a standard "barrel" from the ThinkPad's charger on one end, and
USB-C on the other. With it, you can charge your laptop with a GaN charger or
a USB-PD enabled battery pack. The main thing is that one of their USB-C ports
must be able to deliver 20V and *at least* 3.25A.

And then I got the idea that with all these innovations I could carry /one/
charger and /one/ external battery and charge /everything/ from them: my laptop,
my phone, my vape, etc. This idea was put to the test after I bought a charger
and battery, both 140W, from Baseus — indeed, they charge both my laptop and
my phone at the same time. And the latter also in "turbo-charging mode" if I
use the second USB-C port.

I also had an idea to replace the standard "barrel" with a USB-C connector
(like in the phone and other modern electronic devices). But after looking [[https://www.xyte.ch/mods/x230/#x230-usb-c][at
the experience of other people]] who modified their ThinkPads in this way, I
gave up on this idea. Such a connector doesn't look particularly reliable —
I'd rather go for a traditional "barrel", it looks more reliable for me.

** Battery recelling

I had two, time-affected batteries:
1. Thinkpad Battery 29+ 6-cell battery — with it, the laptop lived for about
   55 minutes.
2. Thinkpad Battery 29++ with 9 cells — with it, the laptop lived for an hour
   and a half.

I didn't know how to replace dead cells in the battery, as well as about
"pitfalls" when performing such an operation. I only knew that it was
*dangerous* — if something short-circuited or overheated, the cell could catch
fire. That's why they can't be soldered — only spot welding is allowed. Also,
batteries lose a little capacity when heated with a soldering iron. Also, the
plastic safety valve located near the anode may fail from heating. In short,
*just don't* solder 18650 batteries, no matter what saying in various blogposts
on the Internet.

A search brought me to the following places with useful information:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkum7G-0vWg][This should be illegal... Battery Repair Blocking]] — here dudes rebuild a
  battery from a camera and in the process go through different things so I
  don't have to go through them.
- [[https://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?t=135913][X220 Battery Recelling]] — there's a lot of useful tips from a laptop battery
  replacement wizard at the end of the thread.
- [[https://hackaday.io/page/247-replacing-lenovo-laptop-lithium-batteries][Replacing Lenovo laptop lithium batteries]] and [[https://hackaday.io/project/245-replacing-lenovo-laptop-lithium-batteries/details][Project Details]] — the author
  of these articles did not upgrade the battery from X220, but from his
  article I can get some useful ideas on how to replace the cells in the
  battery. Also, at the end of the second article he writes that cell capacity
  is apparently programmed in BMS[fn:bms], so there is no sense to put cells
  with capacity higher than from the factory, if there is no programmer and
  corrected firmware for BMS.
- [[https://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x220#Recalibrate_batteries][Recalibrate batteries]] — this describes the command from the coreboot utility
  kit (=./ectool -w 0xb4 -z 0x06=) to calibrate the battery.

Armed with all this knowledge, I started to disassemble the Thinkpad Battery
29+ — it's the least to be pitied. And it will probably burn less than a big
9-cell battery 😊.

I had to figure out on my own how to carefully get to the battery's insides —
because in different YouTube videos, where dudes from South-East Asia
supposedly show how to disassemble the Thinkpad battery, they actually
barbarically dismantle the battery, leaving behind a plastic case bent in all
directions and nickel lines' shreds. I might throw the battery into a rock
crusher with the same result...

The top battery cover — the one with the "do not disassemble" label and
markings — is glued into the main case and is additionally held there by
plastic latches. I was lucky and was able to get into the gap between the
cover and the case, in the corner — where the seam goes from the top of the
battery, not from the side. At first, I separated the two parts with a metal
spatula, without going deep inside, for fear of shorting out something and
catching fire.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt start open 29plus battery
[[file:battery29plus_open1.jpg]]

Then I sharpened a popsicle stick, took a toothpick and proceeded to unglue
the battery, using wooden tools if I needed to get somewhere deep:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt opening 29plus battery
[[file:battery29plus_open2.jpg]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt opening 29plus battery
[[file:battery29plus_open3.jpg]]

The seams on the side of the battery were a bit tricky to work out — I didn't
immediately understand how they there glued, so the battery lost a bit of its
appearance 😊. The seam that goes on the right side of the connector had to be
opened very carefully — inside the case there is an insulated line, which
definitely should not be damaged.

In the end, it all worked out for me:

#+CAPTION: 3S2P battery with BMS board connected
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt opened 29plus battery
[[file:battery29plus_opened.jpg]]

In the photo above, there is a temperature sensor glued to the middle bottom
cell, overheating of which will cause the BMS to burn the fuse (and possibly
set some sort of Permanent Failure Flag internally) — and eventually the
battery will stop working altogether.

The orange battery cells in the photo are LGABC21865, 18650 form factor, with
a capacity of 2800 mAh each. Each battery delivers 3.7V normally, max. 4.3V —
these numbers are the ones you should be guided by. So you don't inadvertently
buy batteries designed for 4.2V, as one Reddit dude did, when he inadvertently
built a ThinkBomb instead of a ThinkPad.

Next is the hard part — you have to disconnect the old batteries from the BMS
so that it doesn't lock up. Alas, I could not find any information on how to
successfully replace cells in Thinkpad X220 battery on the Internet. Mostly
there was only advice on other Thinkpad models: [[https://www.yousun.org/archives/1572][one man disconnecting the
cells in the right order]], another just connected 12+ volts from a lab power
supply to the BMS board terminals and the battery controller didn't lock (it
is not clear why — because the terminals for controlling the voltage between
the cells would then have 0V), and so on.

I tried to figure it all out myself. I found the non-recoverable fuse
quickly — it is =F1= fuse:

#+CAPTION: Fuse 12AH3
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt battery fuse
[[file:bms_fuse.jpg]]

A search quickly gave me a datasheet with a useful picture:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt fuse drawing
[[file:bms_drawing.jpg]]

Everything is obvious here — it is necessary to temporarily unsolder pin 4
from the board to "neutralize" the fuse for the time of cell
replacement. Unfortunately, it is an SMD part with pins *under it*, located too
close to the battery cells to remove it with a soldering dryer, so I gave up
this idea.

There was nothing useful in the datasheet for the BMS chip that could help me
with: "how to start the battery after replacing the cells?" Alas, the only
thing left was to experiment /with the correct sequence of disconnecting/ the
cells from the battery as described in one of the links above.

For the test, I disconnected only the plus terminal (=V+=) of the battery
assembly and soldered it back on. After this operation, the battery output was
0V, although the =F1= cell was still conductable. But then I remembered battery
"startup procedure" in one of the articles I read. I have to short the plus
terminal of the battery pack and the plus terminal on the connector to the
laptop for a while. I *pinged* and soldered the first wire I found on the table
to =V+= and applied it to the correct pin for a second.

The battery output was still 0V. But then I decided to measure the voltage
between the end of the wire and the ground (=V-=) of the battery pack. *Suddenly*,
it was not 12.2V, but 4V! The wire turned out to be made of a "known
substance", it was immediately thrown out, and a quality copper wire was
soldered in its place. After repeating the trick from above, the much desired
11+ volts appeared on the battery connector outputs!

This is how a working method of disconnecting the battery was found:
1. Get the temperature sensor away from the soldering iron.
2. Unsolder the plus contact of the battery assembly: =V+=.
3. Unsolder the next contact: =VH=.
4. Unsolder another contact: =VL=.
5. Unsolder the minus contact of the battery pack: =V-=.

Now the BMS board and the batteries are disconnected from each other and you
can replace the cells with fresh ones! After completing this action,
everything must be connected in reverse order:
1. Solder in series, one after the other, the connectors from the battery
   assembly to the corresponding pins: =V-=, =VL=, =VH=, =V+=.
2. Solder a good quality copper wire to =V+=.
3. Short the other end of the wire and the plus contact on the battery
   connector (left-most contact) for a second.

Done, the BMS should start again and output voltage to the appropriate battery
connector pins.

Unfortunately, I can't say that this method is 100% working, because I didn't
have time to test it properly. It turned out that my "brilliant" idea to clean
the solder joint from flux with vodka (да-да, она самая), for lack of anything
more suitable at hand late at night — led to a fatal failure. Alcohol
evaporated, water remained and "suddenly" right on the soldering mask near the
soldering point — multimeter suddenly started to show 4V instead of
zero. Naturally, BMS didn't like this and it stopped working — either it got
locked or burned out and repeated execution of the above written instructions
didn't help...

In the end, having already spent a lot of time experimenting with this
battery, I decided to spend some time looking at China-manufactured battery
reviews and bought a ThinkPad Battery 29++ replica. I was lucky and the
battery I received was fine — it charged properly and provided 5-6 hours of
battery life while surfing the web.

** Second battery for the laptop (unfinished)

For a long time, I've wanted to add a second battery to my laptop — the
[[https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_Battery_19%2B][ThinkPad Battery 19+]]. It's a big, heavy, and reliable 6-cell battery that
attaches from the bottom, to the dock connector. As [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatch_(film)][Boris the Blade]] used to
say: "Heavy is good, heavy is reliable".

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt boris the blade
[[file:ab95c10e2789777c99b9dd5b7b77a8590018c86a8910663dda47c1ac203a13de.jpg]]

To put it mildly, I'm not a fan of the current trend of unrestrained thickness
reduction of wearable tech at any cost — at the cost of a non-removable
glued-in battery, identical flat keyboards, at the cost of removing the
Ethernet port and 3.5mm jack. Vice versa, I really like the aesthetics of tech
from 1980-1990 movies. It looks moderately thick, has lots of useful buttons,
indicators and ports:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt cursed keyboards
[[file:old_school.webp]]

Maybe when I become a 90-year old man, I will care about the extra 500 grams
of weight and extra millimeters of thickness. But now, carrying "extra" half a
kilo of hardware in my backpack doesn't bother me — it's more important that
my laptop looks like a stylish brick from the 90s and causes pleasant tactile
sensations.

I didn't see any special problems with finding the above-mentioned battery on
the /secondary market/. But, *all of a sudden*, it turned out that in reality such
batteries can now be found only on the inaccessible to me eBay. Even on
AliExpress or Avito (Russian OLX) they are not available.

So it's time to try to make such a battery myself!

I bought a [[https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_UltraBase_Series_3][ThinkPad UltraBase Series 3]] docking station for this purpose. I had
an idea to connect a second 9-cell battery /on the front/ of the dock, like in
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Latitude#/media/File:Dell_Latitude_D630_8064.jpg][Dell Latitude D630]], so that it would also work as a palmrest. The free
space at the back of the docking station, where the ThinkPad Battery 19+
apparently has a 6-cell battery, was already occupied by a board with various
connectors. I was not going to remove this board, because I wanted to have
connectors on the back of the laptop. In the end, it was going to be a
"stylish brick" in the style of the 90's, as I wanted.

First, I disassemble everything. I couldn't find manual for this docking
station, but I managed to find a [[https://joes-tech-blog.blogspot.com/2017/09/whats-inside-lenovo-docking-station-for.html][post about disassembling]] a similar one. It
made it clearer what to expect inside.

I unscrewed *all* the screws, unclipped the plastic latches on the top cover and
removed it:

#+CAPTION: 15 screws on the top cover of the docking station
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt dock station screws
[[file:dock_screws.jpg]]

Inside, there's a main board with a docking connector and mechanics to connect
the dock with the laptop:

#+CAPTION: Inside the UltraBase Series 3 docking station

[[file:dock_internals.jpg]]

Underneath the board is the mechanical part of the dock and /lots/ of grease:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt dock stattion mechanics
[[file:dock_mechanics.jpg]]

It remains to understand how to connect the second battery here. If we take
the main battery, the connector for its (=CN23=) on the circuit diagram looks
like this:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt battery 0 schematics
[[file:bat1_schematics.png]]

You can see that there are 5 lines from the battery:
- Power: =M-BAT-PWR_IN=, aka =BAT_VCC= on the connector
- Ground
- SMBus interface lines: =I2C_CLK_BT0= and =I2C_DATA_BT0=
- =M_TEMP= signal from the =TEMP= pin on the =CN23= connector.

On the same schematic sheet, you can see the corresponding lines coming from
the docking connector:
- Power: =S_BAT_PWR_A=
- SMBus interface lines: =I2C_CLK_BT1= and =I2C_DATA_BT1=
- =S_TEMP= signal.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt battery 1 schematics

The same lines on the sheet with the docking connector:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt battery 1 docking connector
[[file:bat2_schematics2.png]]

Unfortunately, I had to stop further exploration. It turned out that there was
only one place in the dock where I could fit the entire battery — the space
occupied by the board with USB and other plugs. I didn't want to remove this
board; the space on the left was occupied by the mechanism for holding the
ThinkPad in the docking station; the space on the right — by the disk drive
basket, which I also didn't want to remove, because here I can insert Optibay
and add a third hard disk to the system if necessary.

And in the front, where I could insert the battery compartment (cut out of the
ThinkPad case) there was a drain for water. Naturally, it would be dangerous
to remove it and insert a battery into the place, because any spilled water
would go straight to the battery.

Someday I will think about the problem of embedding the battery into the
docking station, but not now....

* Additional connectors and buttons

However, I can still use the docking station to keep all sorts of connectors
behind the laptop — no wires to prevent me from putting a mug of tea on the
side of the laptop.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt reject modernity embrace tradition

But, once the 2K modification board is installed, I can't just plug the
docking station into my laptop anymore! As you can see in the "[[* New display and FreeBSD][New display and
FreeBSD]]" section, this board occupies the Display Port interface lines and a
USB lines. Therefore, I need to disconnect the Display Port lines from the
corresponding connector on the side of the docking station. And at the same
time, check to see if the USB hub in the dock is using the same lines as the
modification board.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a schematic of the docking station on the
Internet, so I had to ping the circuitry from the docking connector. It turned
out rather quickly that the Display Port connector on my docking station will
remain functional — it uses =DOCKA_DP= lines, while the 2K-modification board
uses separate =DOCKB_DP= lines.

But the =USBP8= lines, alas, are used. They go to Microchip's USB2514B
controller (=U13= chip), and it won't be possible to use 4 USB2.0 ports at the
back of the docking station. =USBP8= lines will have to be disconnected from the
connector.

#+CAPTION: USB-controller Microchip USB2514B (U13)
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt usb controller on dock-station
[[file:dock_usb_controller.jpg]]

On the laptop diagram you can see that =USBP12= (=DOCK_USB=) lines are also
connected to the docking station connector — in idea, I can cut =USBP8= lines
directly on the docking station board and solder a twisted pair with a screen
to them, the other end of which will be soldered to the contacts coming from
=USBP12= line. And then USB ports on the back of the docking station will work
again. But I'll make this modification some other time.

I was also going to add a toggle switch to the dock instead of the power
button, and a protective cover for the toggle switch. I have an unhealthy
interest in such protective covers — they click nicely and you can feel the
spring resistance when you flip the cover off.

Plus, every time I turn the laptop on, I feel like a starship pilot from old
sci-fi movies:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt tumbler fantastic
[[file:space_riders.jpg]]

There is just the right place for the toggle switch and protective cover on
the left side of the docking station, opposite the lever for removing the
laptop:

#+CAPTION: Drawing of the toggle switch hole
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt tumbler drawing
[[file:tumbler_drawing.jpg]]

I soldered the wires from the toggle switch to the connector that is used to
connect the standard power button. It wouldn't be possible to solder directly
to the docking connector, because its contacts are located at the bottom of
the board where the mechanical parts moving:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt tumbler connection
[[file:dock_tumbler_conn.jpg]]

At the same time, as you can see, the cable running from the main board to the
button, to signal the disconnection event of docking station, has been
removed. I definitely won't be disconnecting one from the other while laptop
is turned on.

The protective cover was simply glued on with Poxipol and all ended up with
this design:

After connection of the already assembled docking station to the laptop, it
turned out that I had missed something — there were artifacts on the screen,
and the system, although successfully booted to the desktop, soon restarted as
if by watchdog. Since I had no desire to disassemble the docking station
again, and of course there was no documentation for the proprietary docking
connector, I took the broken motherboard from shelf and started to ping the
pins of his connector:

#+CAPTION: Dock connector (CN15), with dust cover removed
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt docking connector pins
[[file:docking_connector_notebook.jpg]]

I must admit that it was a real pain in the ass — the pins, which I know the
pinout of, are located on one side of the board, while the dock connector pins
are located on the other side, and they are extremely small. My eyes broke
trying to count the number of the first pin from the =DOCKB_DP= bus. I had to
cover the contacts to the left of the "ringed" one pin with a piece of tape,
photograph a part of the connector on my phone, enlarge the photo and count
the number of the contact already on it.

After a couple of evenings of such "fun" I already knew which pins on the
connector belong to =DOCKB_DP= lines, and which to =USBP8=:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt docking connector pinout

|------------+-------------------|

|         37 | DOCKB_DP_3N       |

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt docking connector pinout

|         21 | USBP8+      |
|         22 | USBP8-      |
|------------+-------------|

So I simply taped the =DOCKB_DP= and =USBP8= pins in the dock connector with
Kapton tape. As a result, glitches and system restarts disappeared. Connectors
on the back: charging port, Ethernet port and audio jack — worked. The USB
ports of course did not work anymore.

#+CAPTION: Taped pins in the dock connector
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt docking connector glued
[[file:docking_connector3.jpg]]

As a result, the vibe from working at the laptop after such modification
became exactly what I wanted. Opening the laptop, I feel that the display lid
is just a lid, and underneath is a large, reliable and heavy main part with
the keyboard, which you don't have to hold on to keep it from coming off the
table. Tactile sensations when turning on the laptop through the toggle switch
are also on top, as well as the sound accompaniment of this action. Another
unexpected consequence — due to the fact that the laptop is now a bit taller
and the keyboard is slightly tilted towards the user, it has become a bit more
comfortable to work at it.

Toward the end, I added additional USB3.0 connectors to the laptop via Express
Card. First, I bought an FL 1100 card from the AliExpress — it has three ports
instead of two and did not require an additional power cord like other similar
cards.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt fl1100 card
[[file:fl1100.jpg]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt fl1100 card

Everything worked, but the card was heating like an iron, wouldn't snap into
the slot and shutdown after a few minutes after system booting:

#+begin_example

#+end_example

In the end, I had to use ExpressCard BC398 with two USB3.0 ports and an
additional connector for external power supply from another USB connector — in
case I need to connect something power-hungry like a portable hard disk.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt bc398 card
[[file:bc398.jpg]]

There were no more problems with this card — it successfully locked inside the
slot, didn't get warm and didn't turn off after ~10 minutes in use.

* Stitching a new case

With such a laptop you don't want to use an ordinary cloth case from
mass-market. And let's be honest, you can't find a case for such a machine
anymore — everything you can buy now is designed for modern thin laptops.

Since I know how to work with leather — I just sewed a case myself. Few months
ago I bought half of a cattle hide to make all sorts of cases for my
equipment. It is black and vegetable tanned (so that it can be molded).

I don't use patterns — I usually figure out what I want first by sketching in
a notebook:

#+begin_quote
I hope, the drawings will be understandable itself, without
translation. Anyway, there are just lines with the names of the parts of the
case.

If there are no some dimensions on the drawing — then you feel free to choose
it by yourself, as you like.
#+end_quote

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt leather case drawings
[[file:leather_case_drawing1.webp]]

Since I'm used to stuffing my laptop into my backpack sideways, it will also
be inserted same way into the case, tumbler side down. To prevent the laptop
from resting on the protective cover of the toggle switch alone, there will be
some foam on the bottom of the case. On top of this there is a flap with a
couple holster buttons, on which two straps will be slipped.

At first, I wanted to make the front and back walls out of a single piece of
leather so I'd have less cutting to do. But then it suddenly turned out that
the rest of the purchased hide is too small and I can't cut out of it a plate
with a length of more than a meter. I had to redraw the drawing and designed
two separate parts for the front and back walls, which would be sewn together.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt leather case drawings
[[file:leather_case_drawing2.webp]]

And then I simply marked out the details of the cover on the skin, carefully
checking all the dimensions several times, and cut it. It happens in much the
same way as in locksmithing. It's even a little easier, because the leather
can be stretched a little if you made a mistake of a couple of millimeters.

Some fun marking tips: a regular plate works well as a template for the cutout
on the front wall:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt plate as pattern for case
[[file:leather_case_pattern.jpg]]

And for forming semicircular folds on the bottom and on the lid of the case —
two tall Dr. Pepper cans are perfect, rolled together with duct tape. They are
just about 60 mm in diameter, as I needed.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt folding and dr pepper
[[file:leather_case_folding.jpg]]

The front and back walls are joined with a cross stitch as described [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxWiJ20esyo][in this
video]] (RU language). The side panels are sewn using the same method
described in Al Stohlman's book "The art of hand sewing
leather"[fn:leather_box].

The inside of the cover should be covered with lining fabric. The underside of
a leather is abrasive and the laptop will simply wipe to metal over time if
underside is not covered. In a good way, I should have sewn some sort of pouch
to the dimensions of the inside of the case. But to speed up the process, I
just glued the lining fabric to the underside of the corresponding parts.

In the end, after sewing all the parts together, polishing the edges and
installing the holster buttons, I got this case:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt leather case
[[file:leather_case.jpg]]

The notebook fits in it like a glove — obviously it couldn't be otherwise, if
everything was carefully measured and calculated beforehand :-).

* 17.07.2024 update

Unfortunately, the display died after a couple months of use. After the laptop
was turned on in the sunlight so that the sun was shining on the bottom
quarter of the lid — the image on the bottom 1/4 of the display started to
look as if it was hit with a sharp object.

I assume that uneven thermal expansion of the display basket and the display
itself played a role here. It is also possible that the display was not
delivered from China very carefully — the parcel with it was lying unmoved for
about 20 days in the Cainiao warehouse in St. Petersburg and it is not known
what happened to it there.

Before installing the new display, I modified a homemade display basket to
minimize the likelihood of repeated breakage:
- I drilled *a lot* of holes in the plexiglass behind the display so that there
  would be a normal heat exchange with the rest of the laptop cover.
- I glued the display to the basket only on two strips of tape on the sides of
  it, not as /securely/ as it was before — so that the basket would bend during
  thermal expansion, not the matrix (and it bends, of course, better than the
  display itself).

At the moment the screen is stable again and is not going to break.

* Notes

[fn:pause] I use the =Pause= button to pause applications that load the
processor to 100% but I need it for something else. I also use it to save
battery power — if Firefox is used once in a while, it is paused while I don't
need it. [[https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2018/09/19/freebsd-desktop-part-16-configuration-pause-any-application/][It works like this]].
[fn:ips_problem] This is a problem with the IPS matrices used in these
Thinkpads — when you hit the cover hard, a spot appears on the screen. This
spot glows slightly brighter than the surrounding screen:
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt spots on the screen :align center
[[file:ips_display_problem.jpg]]
[fn:1st_mb_fail] In fact, the first motherboard had been dying for a long
time, but since I used the laptop carefully, similar "symptoms" occurred only
a couple of times. And tampering with the system with a soldering iron only
accelerated the inevitable demise.
[fn:freebsd_coreboot_fix] [[https://libreboot.org/docs/bsd/#freebsd-and-corebootfb][As I read]], libgfxinit with initialized framebuffer
and *BSD installers don't working together. But I found a way to make them
friends — during the boot process, when lines are already printed on the
screen:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Booting from Hard Disk ...
/
#+END_EXAMPLE
... you should actually see the bootloader screen in text mode. At this point,
blindly press =<Esc>= and type =vbe on=. This will bring up the bootloader command
prompt, and you can safely boot FreeBSD with the =boot= command.
[fn:bdc] Refer to "2030 Bluetooth daughter card (BDC-2.1)" on page 91 in the
service manual.
[fn:kbd_layouts] Globally, there are two keyboard layouts. British — where the
L-shaped =Enter=, short left =Shift= and there is an additional button with the
symbols =<=, =>=, =\= to the left of the =z= button. And American, with elongated
=Enter= and long =Shift= too.
