  My name is Eugene. Hello, and welcome to my blog! I would say that when the
  thought: "Wow, I did something unique and incredible!"Â â€” comes to my headÂ â€”
  I can't wait to share it with the whole world!ðŸ˜Š
</p>

<p>
  In my blog you can find posts about my main hobbies:
  <ul>
    <li>
      I love IT! You'll often find me at the computer keyboard doing all kinds
      of interesting, funny and <i>crazy</i> tech stuff. For instance, I
      recently had a chance to compile <i>my new</i> PalmOS application,
      written in Java 1.5, which was a great challenge. I also had the
      opportunity to solder an extension 2K board to the motherboard of my
      notebook, which was really exciting. And then I'll write a really
      detailed text about these things.
    </li>

      Photography â€” since digital cameras were invented, I can carry another
      one small computer with a big lens with me. And I would like to think
      what this is so cool! Also, shooting a nice photos and processing them
      in RawTherapee is an absolute blast for me! I absolutely love doing
      street photography, shooting birds and nice mechanisms on film or
      digital camera.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bicycle. There are no computers on it (except for the cycling
      computer). But it makes pedaling meditative. And it's always a great
      idea to get some exercise when you have a sedentary job!
    </li>

    <li>
      Leathercraft is the best part! In my personal life, when I can do
      something with my hands â€” it is the best thing ever for my mental
      health. Also, it is really enjoyable, when I get <i>something</i>
      <i>tangible</i> as a result, not just an ephemeral abstraction in code
      inside a Git repository.
    </li>
  </ul>
