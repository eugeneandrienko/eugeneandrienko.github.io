  Hello! My name is Eugene and this is my blog. When a thought comes into my
  head: Â«Wow, such a cool thing I know! I should to share it with the whole
  world!Â» â€” a new post appears here ðŸ˜Š
</p>

<p>
  Here you can find posts about my main hobbies:
  <ul>
    <li>IT â€” I usually write about different <i>crazy</i> things</li>
    <li>Photography â€” since digital cameras were invented, I can carry another
    one small computer w. big lens with me. And this is cool!</li>
    <li>Bicycle. There are no computers on it (except cycling computer). But
    it makes pedaling meditative!</li>
    <li>Leathercraft â€” good to mental health when you can do something with
    your hands. And get <i>thing</i> as a result, not an ephemeral design in
    git-repository.</li>
  </ul>
