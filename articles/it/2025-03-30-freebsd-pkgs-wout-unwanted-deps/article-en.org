My everyday FreeBSD system has two good old components for graphics and
sound — the X Server and the OSS. There are simple reasons to use these
components — they are mature, they have tons of user documentation, use case
examples, etc. I also like the way these things have been used in the FreeBSD
world. Let me quote [[https://vermaden.wordpress.com/][vermaden]], who wrote well (about the OSS) in the [[https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2020/09/07/quare-freebsd/][Quare
FreeBSD?]] blogpost:

#+begin_quote
Not many people expect from FreeBSD to shine in that department but it shines
a lot here and not from yesterday but from decades. Remember when Linux got
rid of the old OSS subsystem with one channel and came up with ‘great’ idea to
write ALSA? I remember because I used Linux back then. Disaster is very polite
word to describe Linux audio stack back then … and then PulseAudio came and
whole Linux audio system got much worse.

...

Lets get back to FreeBSD audio then. What FreeBSD offered? A whooping 256 OSS
channels mixed live in kernel for low latency. Everything audio related just
worked out of the box – and still works today.
#+end_quote

This is where I see the pattern. If in the Linux world there are many examples
of throwing away software that has served people for years or decades and can
(and should, I think) be updated to adapt to the changed reality (e.g.
=ifconfig=). Then in the FreeBSD world such software just … gets the necessary
updates and continues to be used.

In my journey to install and use the simple system with the good old software
I encountered some problems. Sometimes, when I install a simple program, like
conky or dunst — the pkg tries to install Wayland as a dependency! Or
PulseAudio (thankfully, there is no SystemD in the FreeBSD world). Of course,
I *do not want* these things in my simple system based on the X server, OSS and
good old initialization scripts.

As stated [[https://mastodon.bsd.cafe/@TomAoki][@TomAoki@bsd.cafe]] — some binary packages for FreeBSD have been built
with the same dependencies that came from upstream — to minimize maintainer's
work, which is obviously hard[fn:tomaoki].

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Screenshot of TomAoki reply in Mastodon
[[file:tomaoki.png]]

As a result, some packages came to my machine with unwanted dependencies or
compile-time options that were not ideal for me. For example, the native for
BSD =sndio= sound server is disabled by default in the
=mutlimedia/audacious-plugins= port. But those "linuxisms" — like PulseAudio and
PipeWire — are enabled🤷‍♂️.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Compile time configuration for audacious-plugins with pulseaudio and pipewire options enabled
[[file:audacious-plugins.png]]

I was very surprised to see the =pulseaudio= process in the top 5 CPU consuming
processes while listening to my music. My sound system using OSS and sndio,
why is PulseAudio here?!🤔 After that I started to think about removing
unwanted dependencies from my packages completely…

Or another example — when I install some graphical application based on the
QT6 or GTK3/GTK4 — not only the necessary graphical libraries are installed as
dependencies but also a lot of Wayland stuff. Even if my system doesn't use
Wayland, I have packages of /these things/ installed:

#+begin_example
% pkg info -a | /usr/bin/grep wayland
qt6-wayland-6.8.2              Qt6 wrapper for Wayland
wayland-1.23.1                 Core Wayland window system code and protocol
wayland-protocols-1.39         Wayland protocols
#+end_example

At some point, I decided to override this and get my versions of packages
without unwanted dependencies. A naive approach — just build some packages
without unwanted compile-time options via the Ports infrastructure — almost
works for me.

Almost. When the corresponding package from the FreeBSD repository was
updated — it overwrites my custom package, built with ports. A solution I
found — were far from ideal solution. I can lock my package so that it will
not be updated with the same binary package from the repository. And
temporarily unlock it when I want to update the /my/ package via the ports
infrastructure.

In the FreeBSD Handbook, section 4.6 [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/#ports-poudriere]["Building Packages with poudriere"]], there
was another way to accomplish my task without such update problems. I can
build my own local repository with some packages that have PulseAudio/Wayland
dependencies removed. And this is not a some hacky thing — as far as I can
see, the poudriere used by the FreeBSD maintainers to build the binary
packages:

#+begin_example
% pkg info emacs
...
Annotations    :
        FreeBSD_version: 1401000
        build_timestamp: 2025-02-27T01:04:32+0000
        built_by       : poudriere-git-3.4.2
#+end_example

And it works pretty simple — poudriere just reuses existing FreeBSD
infrastructure to build packages. Package sources taken from [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/#ports-using][ports]] (via
git/https), binary packages downloaded from existing FreeBSD repositories via
the [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/#pkgng-intro][pkg]], build process itself runs inside the [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/][jail]] and all corresponding files
can be stored in the separate [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/][ZFS]] dataset — so the dataset with the root
filesystem will not be polluted by the build-time dependencies or building
artifacts, like object files or logs.

At the end, poudriere will create the local repository with packages. The same
repository as the main FreeBSD repository, but /local/ and with only necesary
packages. Poudriere doesn't force me to build the whole system on my machine.

The main selling point is that all packages installed from this repository
will be updated through *this* repository. They will not be overwritten by
updates from the main FreeBSD repository. This is because the =pkg= adds the
annotation with repository name to the installed package and uses it when
updating:

#+begin_example
% pkg info -A conky
conky-1.22.1:
        FreeBSD_version: 1402000
        build_timestamp: 2025-03-23T14:58:18+0000
        built_by       : poudriere-git-3.4.2
        cpe            : cpe:2.3:a:conky:conky:1.22.1:::::freebsd14:x64
        port_checkout_unclean: no
        port_git_hash  : 6bcf1e971
        ports_top_checkout_unclean: no
        ports_top_git_hash: 3fe34c578
        repo_type      : binary
        repository     : LocalRepo
#+end_example

The second selling point: I can setup all these machinery on a separate disk,
which I mainly use for QEMU/bhyve VMs and other /big things/. This way, my build
infrastructure doesn't take up space on the root filesystem.

* Poudriere installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: poudriere-installation
:END:

Before I welcomed poudriere to my laptop, I created a separate dataset for
poudriere-related files:

#+begin_example
# zfs create hdd/poudriere
# zfs set compression=gzip hdd/poudriere
#+end_example

The only files, which are stored in the root filesystem are configuration
files:
- Build options for the ports — stored in the
  =/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/jail-port-set-options/=.
- Blacklist for unwanted ports: =/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/blacklist=.
- =make.conf= for poudriere jails: =/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/make.conf=.
- And the poudriere configuration itself, of course.

Then, after installing the poudriere package, I slightly changed the default
configuration file and added the following options to use =/hdd/poudriere/=
dataset as the main path for both the jail and the local repository, not my
main dataset with the root filesystem:

#+begin_src shell
ZPOOL=hdd
#NO_ZFS=yes
ZROOTFS=/poudriere
# The directory where poudriere will store jails and ports
BASEFS=/hdd/poudriere
TIMESTAMP_LOGS=yes
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=259200
#+end_src

Also, I increased max time of build process to 3 days — because 1 day may not
be enough to build /big things/. And because it is very sad to spend 24 hours
for building and receive nothing as a result😟.

By the way, I don't want to build LLVM, or Rust, or other build-time
dependencies from sources — I'm fine with the packaged versions. So to don't
spend a time for it, I instruct poudriere to download and use binary packages
for these dependencies:

#+begin_src shell

                         libproxy"
#+end_src

Also, I put the next lines to the =/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/make.conf=, to
prevent enabling the unwanted options when configuring the port(s):

#+begin_src shell
DISABLE_LICENSES=yes
OPTIONS_UNSET+=JACK PIPEWIRE PULSEAUDIO WAYLAND
OPTIONS_SET+=OSS SNDIO X11
#+end_src

To the =/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/blacklist= I've added the next lines:

#+begin_example
audio/pulseaudio
graphics/wayland
multimedia/pipewire
#+end_example

With this configuration poudriere will neither install unwanted packages from
repository, nor build it from ports.

The next steps, including initializing the jail and ports, are well described
in the corresponding chapter of the FreeBSD Handbook. With one *valuable*
exception! When I create the poudriere ports, the proper quarterly branch
should be specified! Like this:

#+begin_example
# poudriere ports -c -p local -m git+https -B 2025Q1
#+end_example

Without the proper branch I'll faced the obscure dependency problems when
downloading the build-time depenedencies as packages:

#+begin_example
[00:00:48] [Dry Run] Package fetch: Skipping cmake-core-3.31.6: remote version mismatch: cmake-core-3.31.3
[00:00:48] [Dry Run] Package fetch: Skipping gettext-runtime-0.23.1: remote version mismatch: gettext-runtime-0.23
[00:00:48] [Dry Run] Package fetch: Skipping hs-pandoc-3.6.4: remote version mismatch: hs-pandoc-3.6.1

[00:00:48] [Dry Run] Package fetch: Skipping libedit-3.1.20250104,1: remote version mismatch: libedit-3.1.20240808,1
[00:00:48] [Dry Run] Package fetch: Skipping lua53-5.3.6_1: deps wanted: libedit-3.1.20250104,1
[00:00:48] [Dry Run] Package fetch: Skipping lua53-5.3.6_1: deps remote: libedit-3.1.20240808,1
[00:00:48] [Dry Run] Package fetch: Will fetch hs-cabal-install-3.12.1.0_1
#+end_example

At the end I have an initialized[fn:pkg] and working jail with ports and the
necessary build environment inside. Now it's time to remove unwanted
dependencies from the system!

* Removing unwanted dependencies
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: removing-deps
:END:

For example, let's work with Wayland. First, I got a list of =wayland=-dependent
packages via =pkg required-depends=:

#+begin_example
% pkg required-depends wayland
mesa-dri-24.1.7_1
gtk4-4.16.12
conky-1.22.0
sdl2-2.30.10_1
mesa-libs-24.1.7_1
gstreamer1-plugins-gl-1.24.10
vulkan-loader-1.4.304
dunst-1.10.0
libva-2.22.0
gtk3-3.24.43
libxkbcommon-1.7.0_1
redshift-1.12_2
webkit2-gtk3-2.34.6_10
#+end_example

Let's take =conky= and rebuild it without Wayland dependencies! First, I need an
/origin/ of this package (it's name in the ports) to build it with
poudriere. The =pkg= gave me the answer and I wrote it to the text file — the
list of packages to rebuild:

#+begin_example
% pkg info -o conky
conky-1.22.0                   sysutils/conky
# echo 'sysutils/conky' >> /hdd/poudriere/14amd64-local-workstation-pkglist
#+end_example

Then I configured all the necessary ports with help of the next [[https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Functions.html][zsh function]]:

#+begin_src shell
SHELL="/usr/bin/env zsh" xterm -fa Hack-14 -e \
    "sudo poudriere options -j 14amd64 -p local -z workstation -c $1"
#+end_src

This function takes string with origin as a single argument. It may look a bit
tricky — but I'm using it because ncurses interface to configure build options
is not displaying correctly inside my [[https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat][EAT]]. So I start a separate shell in
XTerm and configure conky and all it's dependencies inside this shell:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt conky package configuration options
[[file:conky-port-options.png]]

After that I start the necessary machinery with the next zsh function:

#+begin_src shell
DUNST_OPTS=(-I ~/.config/dunst/icons/update.svg)
PKGLIST="/hdd/poudriere/14amd64-local-workstation-pkglist"
POUDRIERE_OPTS=(-j 14amd64 -p local -z workstation -f $PKGLIST)

sudo poudriere jail -u -j 14amd64
dunstify "Poudriere" "Jail 14amd64 updated" $DUNST_OPTS

sudo poudriere ports -p local -u
dunstify "Poudriere" "Ports updated" $DUNST_OPTS

while true; do
    dunstify "Poudriere" \
        "Dry run start.\nCheck that all will build correctly before the real😎 build" \
        $DUNST_OPTS
    sudo poudriere bulk $POUDRIERE_OPTS -b quarterly -vn
    read ANSWER?"Is all correct? [y/n/q] "
    if [ "$ANSWER" = "y" ]; then
        break
    elif [ "$ANSWER" = "q" ]; then
        return
    fi;
done

dunstify "Poudriere" "Ports build start..." $DUNST_OPTS
sudo poudriere bulk $POUDRIERE_OPTS -b quarterly
dunstify "Poudriere" "Ports build end" $DUNST_OPTS
#+end_src

There are the next things happen:
1. =local= poudriere ports update and FreeBSD system inside the jail =14amd64=
   update. If there are already built ports and they got updates — the
   necessary ports and its' dependencies will be rebuilt during the next
   stages.
2. Dry-run the build process (=-n=) with the verbose output (=-v=). This is
   necessary to check that all build-time dependencies, specified in the
   =PACKAGE_FETCH_WHITELIST= configuration option, will not be built from
   sources and so on.
3. Ask user about correctness of logs in the console. If not — return to the
   previous stage. Assuming that user will fix something in the
   =/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf= before answering =n= to recheck logs of dry run
   stage.
7. Start build packages in multiple processes, each on it's own CPU core:
   #+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt poudriere build process screenshot
   [[file:poudriere-building.png]]

The "dry-run" stage is necessary to avoid special sort of problems — when the
build-time dependency will not be installed with =pkg= because it depends from
another build-time dependency, not listed in =PACKAGE_FETCH_WHITELIST=.

#+begin_example
[00:01:23] [Dry Run] Checking packages for missing dependencies
[00:01:23] [Dry Run] Deleting cmake-core-3.31.3.pkg: missing dependency: expat-2.6.4
[00:01:23] [Dry Run] Deleting gettext-tools-0.23.pkg: missing dependency: libtextstyle-0.23
[00:01:23] [Dry Run] Deleting py311-libxml2-2.11.9_1.pkg: missing dependency: libxml2-2.11.9
#+end_example

The solution is simple — just add necessary package(s) to the
=PACKAGE_FETCH_WHITELIST= or decide to build it from ports.

Ideally, here should be an [[https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere/issues/1129][option to stop the build process]] if packages listed
in the =PACKAGE_FETCH_WHITELIST= will not be fetched. But it is not added yet to
the recent version of poudriere, so I'm using an infinite cycle as a
workaround.

The build process is fast enough, even on my Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2620M CPU @
2.70GHz. Obviously, the big software, like Qt or GTK, will build for
hours. Fortunately, the packages that depend on it were waiting while they
were building, so other CPU cores were free[fn:cpu-cores] and I could use my
system as usual, without any drawbacks😎.

After successfull completion, poudriere will create a local FreeBSD repository
that I can use to install *my* versions of packages without unwanted
dependencies. To use this repo, I simply created the
=/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/LocalRepo.conf= file with the next contents:

#+begin_example
LocalRepo: {
    url: "file:///hdd/poudriere/data/packages/14amd64-local-workstation"
}
#+end_example

Then I launched =pkg update= as usual:

#+begin_example
# pkg update
Updating FreeBSD repository catalogue...
FreeBSD repository is up to date.
Updating FreeBSD-kmods repository catalogue...
Fetching data.pkg: 100%   14 KiB  14.6kB/s    00:01
Processing entries: 100%
FreeBSD-kmods repository update completed. 44 packages processed.
Updating LocalRepo repository catalogue...
LocalRepo repository is up to date.
All repositories are up to date.
#+end_example

And now I'm able to reinstall the conky and get rid of a wayland
dependency. To simplify things, I've just added the next alias to
=/etc/pkg.conf=:

#+begin_example
ALIAS {
    ...
    poudriere-install = "install -r LocalRepo -f"
}
#+end_example

And called the next command:

#+begin_example
# pkg poudriere-install conky
Updating LocalRepo repository catalogue...
Fetching meta.conf: 100%    179 B   0.2kB/s    00:01

Processing entries: 100%
LocalRepo repository update completed. 383 packages processed.
LocalRepo is up to date.
Checking integrity... done (0 conflicting)
The following 1 package(s) will be affected (of 0 checked):

Installed packages to be UPGRADED:
        conky: 1.22.0 -> 1.22.1 [LocalRepo]

Proceed with this action? [y/N]: y
[1/1] Upgrading conky from 1.22.0 to 1.22.1...
[1/1] Extracting conky-1.22.1: 100%
#+end_example

Note, that only the necessary package(s) have been reinstalled. The pkg will
not install all the packages from the =LocalRepo=, only the bare minimum to
provide the working program in the existing system.

As a result, conky has disappeared from the list of wayland-dependent packages
and receive the proper =repository= annotation:

#+begin_example
% pkg required-depends wayland
mesa-dri-24.1.7_1
gtk4-4.16.12
sdl2-2.30.10_1
mesa-libs-24.1.7_1
gstreamer1-plugins-gl-1.24.10
vulkan-loader-1.4.304
dunst-1.10.0
libva-2.22.0
gtk3-3.24.43
libxkbcommon-1.7.0_1
redshift-1.12_2
webkit2-gtk3-2.34.6_10
% pkg query "%n: %R" conky
conky: LocalRepo
#+end_example

* More complex examples of deWaylandization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dewaylandization
:END:

Sometimes it may be necessary to revisit build options and/or reconfigure the
already built package. In my case there was a =libva=. I already built it as a
dependency when rebuilding VLC, but I want to recheck the selected options
before reinstalling the package.

This is where the =poudriere options= comes to the rescue. I can use the =-s=
option to view the package options and the =-c= option to reconfigure
them. Instead of specifying the list of origins to build with the =-f= option, I
just specify the one necessary origin. Note the =-n= option — without it the
poudriere will print configuration for the all packages required by the
specified origin.

#+begin_example
# poudriere options -j 14amd64 -p local -z workstation -ns multimedia/libva
[00:00:01] Ports supports: FLAVORS SUBPACKAGES SELECTED_OPTIONS
[00:00:01] Working on options directory: /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/14amd64-local-workstation-options
[00:00:01] Using ports from: /hdd/poudriere/jails-ports/ports/local
===> The following configuration options are available for libva-2.22.0:
     WAYLAND=off: Wayland (graphics) support
     X11=on: X11 (graphics) support
===> Use 'make config' to modify these settings
[00:00:01] Re-run 'poudriere options' with the -c flag to modify the options.
#+end_example

Looks like the =libva= was configured correctly and I can just install it from
my local repo without any problems.

Much more complex example comes with a =graphics/mesa-dri=. Unfortunately, I
built it with Wayland support, so I will have to reconfigure and rebuild it.

This is where the custom zsh function =bsd-poudriere-reconfigure= comes in to
save me a tons of typing:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt mesa-dri options configuration window, opened with bsd-poudriere-reconfigure function
[[file:mesa-dri-reconfiguration.png]]

Finally, to rebuild the =mesa-dri= and it's dependencies I used the next
command:

#+begin_example
# poudriere bulk -j 14amd64 -p local -z workstation -b quarterly -C graphics/mesa-dri
#+end_example

And install it from =LocalRepo= the same way as I used for =conky= package.

** Ports flavors
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: flavors
:END:

There are some packages exists, without the corresponding ports. For example,
the package =audacious-gtk3= can be installed, but there is only
=multimedia/audactious= port and there are no "Qt/GTK/whatever" options to
configure:

#+begin_example
/usr/ports % pkg info -o audacious-gtk3
audacious-gtk3-4.4.2_1         multimedia/audacious
/usr/ports % ls -d multimedia/audacious*
multimedia/audacious/         multimedia/audacious-plugins/
/usr/ports % pkg query '%n: %Ok' audacious-gtk3
audacious-gtk3: EXECINFO
audacious-gtk3: LIBARCHIVE
audacious-gtk3: NLS
#+end_example

When I built this port as usual, I got the Qt-based package. But I want a GTK
based package because it can display my favourite skin as I want to:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt Audacious plugin with old school Winamp skin :width 80%
[[file:audacious.png]]

It's time to meet the [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/flavors/][flavors]]! Some ports can be built in multiple
variants. And the variants itself can be observed with the simple =fgrep=:

#+begin_example
/usr/ports % fgrep 'FLAVORS=' multimedia/audacious/Makefile
FLAVORS=        qt6 qt5 gtk3 gtk2
#+end_example

So, according to the link above, I can build my =audacious-gtk3= package just by
adding line =multimedia/audacious@gtk3= instead of simple =multimedia/audacious=
to the my =/hdd/poudriere/14amd64-local-workstation-pkglist=. *Note:* the flavor
is specified after the /[at]/ symbol.

** Patching Makefile
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: patching-Makefile
:END:

One of the biggest problems I met, during the recompiling some packages — is
the Qt 6 dependent packages. There were two of them: Telegram Desktop and the
[[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/QMapShack][Qmapshack]].

Telegram Desktop is directly depends from Qt 6 and the Qmapshack depends on
the =bsdisks= package, which depends from the Qt 6 itself (despite the Qmapshack
depends on the Qt 5):

#+begin_example
~ % pkg rquery '%n: %dn %dv : %do' telegram-desktop | /usr/bin/grep qt
telegram-desktop: qt6-shadertools 6.8.2 : x11-toolkits/qt6-shadertools
telegram-desktop: qt6-declarative 6.8.2 : x11-toolkits/qt6-declarative
telegram-desktop: qt6-wayland 6.8.2 : graphics/qt6-wayland
telegram-desktop: qt6-svg 6.8.2 : graphics/qt6-svg
telegram-desktop: qt6-lottie 6.8.2 : graphics/qt6-lottie
telegram-desktop: qt6-imageformats 6.8.2 : graphics/qt6-imageformats
telegram-desktop: qt6-base 6.8.2_1 : devel/qt6-base
telegram-desktop: qt6-5compat 6.8.2 : devel/qt6-5compat
~ % pkg rquery '%n: %dn %dv : %do' qmapshack | /usr/bin/grep bsdisks
qmapshack: bsdisks 0.36 : sysutils/bsdisks
~ % pkg rquery '%n: %dn %dv : %do' bsdisks | /usr/bin/grep qt
bsdisks: polkit-qt-1-qt6 0.200.0 : sysutils/polkit-qt-1
bsdisks: qt6-base 6.8.2_1 : devel/qt6-base
#+end_example

And the problem is in =devel/qt6-base= — it depends from the Wayland directly
and there is no knob to build it without Wayland support:

#+begin_src makefile
LIB_DEPENDS=	libatk-1.0.so:accessibility/at-spi2-core \
        libatk-bridge-2.0.so:accessibility/at-spi2-core \
...
        libvulkan.so:graphics/vulkan-loader \
        libwayland-client.so:graphics/wayland \
        libxkbcommon.so:x11/libxkbcommon \
...
OPTIONS_DEFINE=	CUPS X11
OPTIONS_DEFAULT=	CUPS X11
OPTIONS_SUB=	yes
#+end_src

I tried to remove this line with =graphics/wayland= dependency from the Makefile
but =qt6-base= failed to compile in this case.

I hope the option to compile =devel/qt6-base= without Wayland dependency will be
added in the future. But for now I can just stick with Qt 5.

First package, dependent from Qt 6 — the Telegram Desktop — was simply removed
from my machine. I always encountered problems with this app — it likes to
overload my CPU in random times. So I switched to web version and have no
problems since.

Second package — Qmapshack, dependent from =sysutils/bsdisks=, require more work
on it. Bsdisks itself was pulled to my system directly by Qmapshack and wasn't
necessary for other programs. So, the necessity of bsdisks was questionable —
why is it needed for the mapping program, when I don't use Garmin or other GPS
devices for mapping?

#+begin_example
% pkg rquery '%e' bsdisks
UDisks2 service provides interfaces to enumerate
and perform operations on disks and storage devices
via D-Bus API. Bsdisks is an implementation of UDisks2
service for FreeBSD.
#+end_example

Of course, there is no configuration option to build the =astro/qmapshack=
without =sysutils/bsdisks=. But … it was marked as a runtime dependency in the
Makefile, not a compile time dependency:

#+begin_src makefile
RUN_DEPENDS=	${LOCALBASE}/bin/bsdisks:sysutils/bsdisks
#+end_src

So, it's time to slightly patch the necessary port and try to build Qmapshack
without bsdisks. First, I opened the
=/hdd/poudriere/ports/local/astro/qmapshack/Makefile= and commented this line.

Then, I add =astro/qmapshack= to the
=/hdd/poudriere/14amd64-local-workstation-pkglist= and initiated the build
without updating the ports, so my change will not clash with the updates from
the main repository (if any):

#+begin_example
# poudriere bulk -j 14amd64 -p local -z workstation -b quarterly -nv -C astro/qmapshack
...
[00:00:42] [Dry Run] Dry run mode, cleaning up and exiting

...
# poudriere bulk -j 14amd64 -p local -z workstation -b quarterly -C astro/qmapshack
#+end_example

And it successfully builds and running correctly without =bsdisks=!

Last step: after successfull compilation I reverted my changes in
=astro/qmapshack/Makefile= to avoid unnecessary problems with ports updates.

* Results and thoughts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: results-and-thoughts
:END:

Before, I was using a Gentoo (and compiling the whole system, of course) which
=emerge= system was inspired by FreeBSD ports. Comparing these two system, I can
say that ports infrastructure looks like simplier for me.

When I recompiled the program in the Gentoo with the new options I usually did
the next:
1. Run =emerge --ask program-name= to see the USE flags of program *and* it's
   dependencies.
2. If I want to change something and need to see the exact meaning of some USE
   flag, I call =equery uses program-name=. Then I open a text file somewhere in
   =/etc/portage/package.use/= and add package atom and the necessary USE flags'
   settings.
3. After that I could start compilation with necessary options.

Looks like for me, the same process in the FreeBSD is simpler. I can configure
build-time options for program and it's dependencies with a single call of
=poudriere options ...= which provides me a useful TUI menu with descriptions of
all of the options. And I don't need to copy it to the some configuration
file — all of them will be inserted in the right place themselves.

Also, all ports infrastructure looks like simplier — it is just a Makefile and
a bunch of human-readable text files with package descriptions and so on!

Of course there are drawbacks:
- Some packages I think (like Qt 6) lack the configuration options.
- If I want to update packages, it is better to update my local repository
  first. Instead, some of the packages will be dependent from the old
  libraries which are already updated in the =FreeBSD= repository. Sometimes it
  will work as usual without any problems, but sometimes, I think, it will be
  break due to API changes.
- If I will update my OS to something like FreeBSD 14.3 — then I should to
  checkout corresponding branch for local ports and update my 14amd64 jail to
  the right version of OS.
- The same is true for major updates.
- And every quarter I should checkout the right branch for the ports, to have
  a synchronization between the binary packages from the FreeBSD repository
  and the ports.

BTW, I got one sudden and major result of un-waylanding of my system. Before,
I was constantly struggling from strange glitches on my display, that looks
like this:

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt strange black glitches on the screen
[[file:freebsd_intel_glitches.jpg]]

I thought what this is because:
1. I used the outdated method of acceleration for X server =intel= driver. So, I
   switched from UXA to Glamor. And this is not helped to me.
2. I used the wrong options for video card powersaving. Revised it and …
   nothing changed.
3. My soldering of AGAN X230 expansion card were bad. So, I recheck it and
   found nothing suspicios.
4. I compiled coreboot not the right way because I specified the wrong initial
   framebuffer resolution when the machine is booting. I switched to
   precompiled libreboot and properly configure it. Aaand … nothing changed.
5. I started to suspect my video card. Maybe my hardware is dying?…🤔

But after I removed Qt6 and Wayland related stuff from my machine, I'm not
seeing these glitches anymore. Before, I was seeing it almost every day. But
for now, two days already passed and all is OK.

[fn:pkg] It may be necessary to build a =ports-mgmt/pkg= before building anything
in the jail. In my case poudriere won't install =cmake-core= because it has
unsatisfied dependency — the =pkg=. Despite the =pkg= of necessary version was
previously bootstrapped to install binary packages in the jail.
[fn:cpu-cores] Except the Qt building process. There is a line in
=/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf=, which instructs to build some packages on the
all accessible CPU cores:

#+begin_src shell
# List of packages that will always be allowed to use MAKE_JOBS
# regardless of ALLOW_MAKE_JOBS. This is useful for allowing ports
# which holdup the rest of the queue to build more quickly.
ALLOW_MAKE_JOBS_PACKAGES="pkg ccache py* vlc qt*"

I added the Qt to it, because it builds so slooow on the one CPU core…
