There are a bunch of tips and tricks about FreeBSD setup for Thinkpad X220 in
this little note. I wrote it to not forget non-obvious actions, wchich should
be done after system installation. Used Thinkpad came from 2011 year — from
that times, when it used decent design from IBM with blue Enter and 7-row
keyboard.

This post based on information from the next pages:
- [[https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x230/]]
- [[https://unrelenting.technology/articles/freebsd-on-the-thinkpad-x240]]
- [[https://github.com/grembo/xorg-udev-setup-check]]

* Show ~ for current directory path in bash prompt

In FreeBSD all users' home catalogs placed in =/usr/home/=. The =/home/= is just a
symbolic link to =/usr/home/=. So, thats why in command prompt =\w= will be
substituted to =/usr/home/catalog_name=, not to =~/catalog_name=.

To fix that you need to set path to home catalog directly to
=/usr/home/user_catalog=, not to =/home/user_catalog=. Use =sudo chsh username= for
this.

* Minimal set of groups

- =wheel= :: for sudo
- =video= :: grants access to =/dev/dri/card*=
- =webcamd= :: grants access to web-camera.

* Power control

=/etc/rc.conf= settings:

#+begin_example
powerd_enable="YES"
powerd_flags="-a hiadaptive -b adaptive -M 2000"
performance_cx_lowest="Cmax"
economy_cx_lowest="Cmax"
#+end_example

=/boot/loader.conf= settings:

#+begin_example
cpufreq_load="YES"
kern.hz=100
#+end_example

Thanks to these settings — notebook will become slowly but more energy-saving.

* Sound

Need to load =snd_hda= module on system startup. Add this to =/boot/loader.conf=:

#+begin_example
snd_hda_load="YES"
#+end_example

To switch between speakers and earphone on the fly — add these lines to
=/boot/device.hints=:

#+begin_example
hint.hdaa.0.nid20.config="as=1 seq=0 device=Speaker"
hint.hdaa.0.nid21.config="as=1 seq=15 device=Headphones"
#+end_example

* Brightness control

Add these lines to =/boot/loader.conf=:

#+begin_example
acpi_ibm_load="YES"
acpi_video_load="YES"
#+end_example

First line loads kernel module to operate with Thinkpad peripherals —
multimedia-keys, brightness-control keys, etc. Second line loads kernel module
to control screen brightness via sysctl (use =hw.acpi.video.lcd0.brightness=
setup).

* Multimedia keys

First, module =acpi_ibm= should be already loaded in system.

The next strings should be added to =/etc/devd.conf=, with them devd could
process Fn+Fkey keypresses and send it to our script:

#+begin_example
notify 10 {
    match "system" "ACPI";
    match "subsystem" "IBM";
    action "/etc/acpi_thinkpad.sh $notify";
};
#+end_example

Script content (incomplete):

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/sh

ACPI_EVENT="$1"

case "$ACPI_EVENT" in
    '0x04')
        /usr/sbin/zzz
        ;;
esac
#+end_src

To watch key scan-codes just stop devd and launch it from root with =-d=
argument.

* Touchpad and trackpoint

First, enable Synaptics touchpad and trackpoint support in =/boot/loader.conf=:

#+begin_example
hw.psm.synaptics_support=1
hw.psm.trackpoint_support=1
#+end_example

Package =xf86-input-synaptics= should be replaced with =xf86-input-evdev=. With
these changes — touchpad, trackpoint and middle mouse button above of touchpad
will be working. Also, scrolling with middle button and trackpoint will work.

I'd like sensitive trackpoint — so I add the next lines to =/etc/systcl.conf=:

#+begin_example
hw.psm.trackpoint.sensitivity=150
hw.psm.trackpoint.upper_plateau=125
#+end_example

* Web-camera

Make next changes in next files:
- =/boot/loader.conf= ::
  #+begin_example
  cuse_load="YES"
  #+end_example
- =/etc/rc.conf= ::
  #+begin_example
  webcamd_enable="YES"
  #+end_example
- =/etc/sysctl.conf= ::
  #+begin_example
  kern.evdev.rcpt_mask=12
  #+end_example

After that add user to =webcamd= group:

#+begin_example
sudo pw groupmod webcamd -m <username>
#+end_example

* Sleep

First, the module =acpi_ibm= should be loaded:

Then, we can go to sleep mode via =acpiconf -s 3= command. Or via =zzz= command.

* Enable drm-kmod

Install the package =graphics/drm-kmod=. After, enable module =i915kms.ko= — add
next line to =/etc/rc.conf=:

#+begin_example
kld_list="${kld_list} /boot/modules/i915kms.ko"
#+end_example

* Wi-Fi

Add next lines to =/boot/loader.conf=:

#+begin_example
if_iwn_load="YES"
wlan_wep_load="YES"
wlan_ccmp_load="YES"
wlan_tkip_load="YES"
#+end_example

And these lines to =/etc/rc.conf= (select proper country code in last line):

#+begin_example
wlans_iwn0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="WPA DHCP powersave"
create_args_wlan0="country RU regdomain NONE"
#+end_example

Install package =wpa_supplicant= to operate with Wi-Fi networks from user
mode. And add next lines to the start of =/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf=:

#+begin_example
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
eapol_version=2
fast_reauth=1
#+end_example

* Miscellaneous

You can add next lines to =/boot/loader.conf=:

#+begin_example
autoboot_delay="2"
kern.maxproc="100000"
kern.ipc.shmseg="1024"
kern.ipc.shmmni="1024"
cpuctl_load="YES"
coretemp_load="YES"
libiconv_load="YES"
libmchain_load="YES"
cd9660_iconv_load="YES"
msdosfs_iconv_load="YES"
#+end_example

These lines enable support of temperature sensors in system, will reduce delay
to two seconds before the system boots and so on.

To load DHCP client in background on system startup and reduce system boot
time — add next line to =/etc/rc.conf=:

#+begin_example
background_dhclient="YES"
#+end_example

To mount filesystems without root privileges, to disable system beeper and so
on — add next lines to =/etc/sysctl.conf=:

#+begin_example
vfs.read_max=128
vfs.usermount=1
hw.syscons.bell=0
kern.vt.enable_bell=0
#+end_example

* 2024-04-28 update

Now, I am using coreboot instead of BIOS on my Thinkpad. Also, I soldered
expansion board AGAN X230 to my motherboard to use nice and shiny
2K-display. As operation system I use FreeBSD 14.0. Thats why I wrote this
update:

** Working sleep mode (S3)

Out of the box, the sleep mode is working incorrectly. Command =sudo zzz= nice
switches laptop to sleep mode. *But*, after wakeup I can see screen with i3wm
for seconds and after that system behaves like I have entered =sudo shutdown -h
now= command. But I didn't enter it either!

After digging on FreeBSD forum, I found a topic, where a man with HP laptop
describing his issues with non-working sleep mode. Suddenly, but advice from
this topic helped me a lot.

There are should be the next lines in =/etc/sysctl.conf=:
#+begin_example
hw.pci.do_power_suspend=0
hw.pci.do_power_nodriver=1
#+end_example

And next in =/boot/loader.conf=:
#+begin_example
hint.p4tcc.0.disabled="1"
hint.acpi_throttle.0.disabled="1"
#+end_example

After restart, sleep mode finally works well as before! Without strange
shutdown after wake up.

To enable sleeping after closing the lid, I've added one more line to
=/etc/sysctl.conf=:
#+begin_example
hw.acpi.lid_switch_state=S3
#+end_example

** Output boot-log to «secondary» 2K-display

Coreboot with SeaBIOS payload FreeBSD bootloader don't works very well
together. If you try to boot FreeBSD on the machine with coreboot, you'll see
a thin line of something like video interference on the top of the screen.

To fix that, you should blindly press Esc in the bootloader. After that, still
/blindly/ enter command =vbe on= and press Enter. Now, bootloader switch the video
mode and it's interface will be displayed on the screen.

Boot to the system with the =boot= command and add next lines to
=/boot/loader.conf=:
#+begin_example
hw.vga.textmode="0"
kern.vty=vt
i915kms_load="YES"
vbe_max_resolution=2560x1440
#+end_example

** Reduce count of messages from system when booting

Add to =/boot/loader.conf=:
#+begin_example
boot_mute="YES"
#+end_example

To =/etc/rc.conf=:
#+begin_example
rc_startmsgs="NO"
#+end_example

** Powersaving for videocard

Add next lines to =/boot/loader.conf=:
#+begin_example
drm.i915.enable_rc6="7"
drm.i915.semaphores="1"
drm.i915.intel_iommu_enabled="1"
#+end_example

** Intel 8260

Because now I'm using WiFi-card Intel 8260 — it should be configured via
[[https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=wifibox&apropos=0&sektion=8&manpath=freebsd-ports&format=html][wifibox]] to use full power of WiFi. Wifibox configuration is simple, takes near
5 minutes and described in these two articles:
- https://jrgsystems.com/posts/2022-04-20-802.11ac-on-freebsd-with-wifibox/
- https://xyinn.org/md/freebsd/wifibox

** Sound and coreboot

Some system internals (nIDs) changed after installation of coreboot instead of
BIOS. As a result: there is no sound in headphones, connected via 3.5mm
jack. Instruction from [[* Sound][Sound]] section became unapplicable.

To see, which nID I shoule use, there is the next command:
#+begin_src bash
dmesg | grep pcm
#+end_src

As a result, I got my headphones working after adding next lines to
=/boot/device.hints=:
#+begin_example
hint.hdaa.0.nid31.config="as=1 seq=0 device=Speaker"
hint.hdaa.0.nid35.config="as=1 seq=15 device=Headphones"
#+end_example

** GUI glitches

After some time of working, there are black squares and (rarely) lines appears
on the screen. Maybe there are because of coreboot. When I switch from =intel=
to =modesetting= driver — it won't help.

#+CAPTION: Glitches on the laptop screen
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center :alt FreeBSD Intel glitches
[[file:freebsd_intel_glitches.jpg]]

But, thanks to [[https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/intel-video-and-screentearing.72085/][this FreeBSD forum message]] and =picom= usage with =--no-vsync=
option, I managed to noticeably decrease frequency of glithes appearance.

As a result, my =/usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-intel.conf= has the next
contents:

#+begin_example
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Card0"
    Driver      "intel"
    BusID       "PCI:0:2:0"
    Option      "Accel"         "true"
    Option      "AccelMethod"           "SNA"
    Option      "DRI"                   "3"
    Option      "TearFree"          "true"
EndSection
#+end_example

And I add next option to =/boot/loader.conf=:
#+begin_example
drm.i915.enable_fbc="1"
#+end_example

** Miscellaneous (2)

To decrease desktop latency under the high load, add next lines to
=/etc/sysctl.conf=:
#+begin_example
kern.sched.preempt_thresh=224
#+end_example

Settings for network stack performance in =/boot/loader.conf=:
#+begin_example
net.link.ifqmaxlen="2048"
cc_htcp_load="YES"
#+end_example

Dock-station support;
#+begin_example
acpi_dock_load="YES"
#+end_example
