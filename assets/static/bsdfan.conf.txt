#Levels are defined with: level(level_number, level_min_temperature, level_max_temperature)
#level_number goes from 0 (fan not active) to 7 (fan at full speed)
#not all levels have to be used

#the first level 'level_min_temperature' must be equal to 0 and the last level 'level_max_temperature' must be >150
#please define levels in ascending order by level_number
#be careful

level (0,0,39)
level (1,38,46)
level (3,39,49)
level (4,44,51)
level (5,46,52)
