#+END_EXPORT

This spring I made a lot of photos. Especially the photos of reptiles and
snakes on the local festival.

Also, I made some experiments with reduced color palletes (like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter][CGA]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Graphics_Adapter][EGA]])
and with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither][dithering]]. Thanks to the [[https://100r.co/site/home.html][Hundredrabbits]] for the inspiration!

* Experiments with CGA/EGA and dithering
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cga-ega-dithering
:END:

Also, I performed an experiments with a reduced color palettes and dithering after reading some articles on the [[https://100r.co/site/home.html]["Hundredrabbits"]] website.

All these transformation were made inside Gimp with the help of some palettes from these sources:
- [[https://www.deviantart.com/theouterlinux/art/GIMP-color-palettes-from-retro-systems-anime-etc-760564991][GIMP color palettes from retro systems, anime, etc]]
- [[https://robert-96.github.io/gimp-color-palettes/][A collection of color palettes for GIMP and Inkscape]].

These palettes were placed to the =~/.config/GIMP/2.10/palettes/=. Each palette
can be applied via the "Image⇒Mode⇒Indexed" dialog box (see the "Use custom
palette" radio button).

The dithering can be applied also via the same dialog.
