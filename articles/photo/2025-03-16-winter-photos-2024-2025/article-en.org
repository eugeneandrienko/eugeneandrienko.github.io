This winter I have photographed much less than usual — because of the mud on
the roads, the temperature around -15°C…-20°C, the almost permanent absence of
sunshine and the gray clouds that completely cover the sky —as much as
possible motivates me to keep my nose out of the street.

Fortunately, there were a couple of days with the sun:

But for the most of the time (if we ignore the New Year decorations) it looked
like this:

The most pictures I've got were from the New Year's day:
