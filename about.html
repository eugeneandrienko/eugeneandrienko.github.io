  My name is Eugene. Hello, and welcome to my blog! I would say that when the
  thought: "Wow, I did something unique and incredible!"Â â€” comes to my headÂ â€”
  I can't wait to share it with the whole world!ðŸ˜Š

  In my blog you can find posts about my main hobbies:
  <ul>
    <li>
      I love IT! You'll often find me at the computer keyboard doing all kinds
      of interesting, funny and <i>crazy</i> tech stuff. For instance, I
      recently had a chance to compile <i>my new</i> PalmOS application,
      written in Java 1.5, which was a great challenge. I also had the
      opportunity to solder an extension 2K board to the motherboard of my
      notebook, which was really exciting. And then I'll write a really
      detailed text about these things.

      Photography â€” since digital cameras were invented, I can carry another
      one small computer with a big lens with me. And I would like to think
      what this is so cool! Also, shooting a nice photos and processing them
      in RawTherapee is an absolute blast for me! I absolutely love doing
      street photography, shooting birds and nice mechanisms on film or
      digital camera.

      Bicycle. There are no computers on it (except for the cycling
      computer). But it makes pedaling meditative. And it's always a great
      idea to get some exercise when you have a sedentary job!

      Leathercraft is the best part! In my personal life, when I can do
      something with my hands â€” it is the best thing ever for my mental
      health. Also, it is really enjoyable, when I get <i>something</i>
      <i>tangible</i> as a result, not just an ephemeral abstraction in code
      inside a Git repository.
    </li>
  </ul>
