<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<h4 id="desktop">Desktop computer</h4>
<p>I've been using the single desktop PC since 2013. I've been assembling it
from various parts that I bought at affordable prices from local computer
stores in 2013-2014:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Motherboard:</b> ASRock Z77 Pro3</li>
<li>
<b>CPU:</b> Intel Core i5-3470 3.2 GHz</li>
<li>
<b>RAM:</b> Four 4Gb DDR3 sticks from Kingston. Each stick has a
radiator.</li>
<li>
<b>HDD:</b> Two disks per 1Tb each. Seagate Barracuda ST1000DM003-1CH162 7200
rpm</li>
<li>
<b>Cooling:</b> Thermaltake cooler on the CPU, 6 additional fans in the
PC case for cooling and one HDD fan on the each hard drive. The usual
temperature of the system: 33°C, temperature under the heavy load: close
to 37°C.</li>
<li>
<b>Videocard:</b> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 Ti. It has only 2Gb of video
memory, but it is enough for Deep Rock Galactic!</li>
<li>
<b>PSU:</b> I used to use the Corsair V550 (550W). But it burned out due
to a failure in the local power grid, so I recently installed a new PSU:
Zalman ZM800-TXII (800W).
</li>
<li>
<b>Case:</b> Zalman Z11 High Performance<br><img alt="Zalman Z11 High
Performance case photo" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit:
cover" src="/assets/images/uses/z11.png">
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I use two monitors with this PC. First, the Benq XI2420z 24" 1080p — it is
still good enough for my use cases (programming, blogging, web surfing,
gaming and video watching).
</p>
<p>
The second display is handmade from broken Asus F6E laptop (reducing
e-waste, baby!):
<img alt="Asus F6E display connected to Raspberry Pi for test" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/f6e.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Just a display from a laptop, some screws and metal corners from the
hardware store, metal sheets cut from an old PC case and a Chinese LVDS
30-pin to HDMI converter.
</p>
<p>
To interact with this computer I use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Mechanical keyboard:</b> Red Square Keyrox TKL Classic Pro. Bought it
for the nice clicking sound. Looks like there is some kind
of <strike>Russian</strike> Chinese brand of cheap mechanical
keyboards. Keycaps and switches are changeable.
<img alt="Black mechanical keyboard with white, blue and red keycaps" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/tkl.png">
Two switches were rattling, so I moved them to the less used
keys. Nevertheless, the keyboard is of sufficient quality.
Before this keyboard, I used Genius KB-09E PS/2 keyboard. It is an
extremely reliable keyboard that I used for 15 years and it still works.
</li>
<li>
<b>Mouse:</b> Logitech G500s. I use it mostly for gaming sessions in
Deep Rock Galactic. I can't say it's reliable enough — over the past 10
years, the cable that comes out of the mouse case has frayed a few times
(but I have a soldering iron). Also, the spring, that pushes the weights
out of the case, has weakened and stopped working.
</li>
<li>
<b>Trackball:</b> Logitech Trackman Marble Trackball. I bought it when I
found a symptom of impending RSI on my right hand. So, I use this
trackball with my left hand every day. It's a reliable piece of
engineering and even the lack of a middle button and scroll button
didn't ruin the experience — I just remapped the "Browser Next" and
"Prev" buttons to the desired functions in the X server configuration.
<img alt="Gray trackball with a big red ball" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/trackball.png">
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="laptop">Laptop</h4>
<p>
Before, since 2019, it was just an ordinary Lenovo Thinkpad X220. I bought
it from the local reseller, who was bought decommissioned laptops in the
Europe and sold them locally to the car mechanics, engineers, students and
so on.
But when I got the inspiration — it became
the <a href="https://eugene-andrienko.com/en/it/2024/07/07/thinkpad-x220-second-life">heavily
modified Thinkpad X2200</a> with <strike>Retina</strike> 2K screen, new
battery, 2 SSDs and 1 HDD and so on.
<img alt="Heavily modified Thinkpad X220" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;
object-fit: cover" src="/assets/static/notebook_after.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, during the gaming sessions (Xonotic, Quake II or Doom) I use it
with an IBM MU29J ball mouse. It is connected to the laptop via the PS/2⇒USB
converter.
<img alt="IBM black ball mouse" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;
object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/mouse.jpg">
</p>
<h4 id="phone">Mobile phone</h4>
<p>
I have been using the Motorola Defy (2021) phone since 2022 year. It was
claimed to be an IP68 enabled and rugged smartphone and that seems to be the
plain truth.
<img alt="Motorola Defy 2021 phone" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;
object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/defy.jpg">
</p>
<p>
I have used this phone in a humid environments, dropped it almost three
times on the asphalt and a several times on the tile floor. Once I dropped
it in a puddle. And you know what? It still works perfectly and the screen
didn't even crack.
</p>
<p>
The one (and the only one) minor injury — the plastic protective frame has a
small dent in the corner where I dropped the phone when I got out of the
car.
</p>
<p>
The battery is still working, providing almost 1.5-2 days without the
charger.
</p>
<p>
When I need to type a lot of text (more than two sentences), I use
the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/keyboards/k380-multi-device.html">Logitech
K380</a> Bluetooth keyboard — because the comfort of using a physical
keyboard with the power of "touch typing" is incomparable to tapping on the
glass screen with the keyboard drawn on it. The ubiquitous use of touch
interfaces for human-computer interaction was a mistake.
</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>
Most of the time I use open source software, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is not controlled by the corporations that care more about
shareholder profits than producing quality software.
As a result, the features and UX/UI of open source software don't
constantly change due to A/B testing to find new ways to grab the user's
attention, personal data, or money.
</li>
<li>
Usually, it provides more functionality and follows
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix
philosophy</a>, which helps me to combine it in necessary ways.
</li>
<li>
Because I have enough skills, I can fix bugs or add a new features to
such software. If I use the proprietary software, I don't even have that
possibility.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
By the way, I still use proprietary software in some cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 and a Steam — to run Deep Rock Galactic. There is no open
source game with the same vibe and nice community.</li>
<li>Telegram — to stay in touch with friends and family.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gpc">General purpose computers</h4>
<p>
On the desktop PC I use Gentoo. For now, it is the one of the small subset
of Linux distributions that provides extremely customizable software and
(with <tt>USE</tt> flags) it is possible to install and use Linux without
modern attempts to turn Linux into bloated Windows clone with purged soul of
Unix from it
(i.e. without <a href="https://www.without-systemd.org/wiki/index_php/Arguments_against_systemd/">systemd</a>,
pulseaudio, avahi-daemon, wayland and so on).
</p>
<p>
I have been using this Linux distribution since 2018 and it seems to be
reliable enough. Just update it every 1-2 months and everything is fine. It
just works.
</p>
<p>
On the laptop I use <a href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a> instead
of a proprietary BIOS and a FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>
On the both machines I use the same set of software:
</p>
<ul>
<li>sh</li>
<li>X server</li>
<li>
<a href="https://stumpwm.github.io/">stumpwm</a><br>
<img alt="My stumpwm desktop with Adine wallpaper and Solarized Light
theme" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/stumpwm.jpg">
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a> for web surfing. Inside
the browser I use the next plugins:</li>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0px">
<li>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/audiocontext-suspender/">AudioContext
Suspender</a> to decrease CPU utilization and battery consumption if
badly programmed website opened.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://decentraleyes.org/">Decentraleyes</a> — to prevent
the browser from making requests to the CDN. Instead, the local cached
scripts/CSSes/whatever are used. It prevents various <i>bad actors</i>
from gathering information about my behavior through my requests to the
CDN.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers#readme">Firefox
Multi-Account Containers</a>. Allows me to open different sites in
different container tabs, so some <i>bad sites</i> don't get too much
information from the browser, because cookies and other things are
separated between containers.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Still-Dont-Care-About-Cookies">I
still don't care about cookies</a> — really, those cookie banners drive
me crazy!</li>
<li>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feed-preview/">Feed
Preview</a> — returns RSS button and RSS feed preview to the
browser.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes/">Return
YouTube Dislike</a> — I think that constant aversion to receiving any
valuable <b>and</b> negative information is the scourge of modern
society. How can I understand that content is worth consuming if I only
see likes but no dislikes?</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile">SingleFile</a> —
to archive the last days of the Internet (the free and international
network that connected different people around the globe). This
extension saves the page and all of it's contents (CSS and JS scripts,
images) into a single HTML file that can be opened in any browser and
doesn't require some tricky daemons or programs to replay the saved
file.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app/">SponsorBlock for YouTube</a> —
because modern YouTube has a worse UX for viewing videos. This extension
removes (for now) all unnecessary interruptions from videos — intros,
sponsor blocks, various ads and other nonsense. It uses a
community-driven DB which is populated by the real people with
timestamps of such things to skip them.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://streetpass.social/">StreetPass for Mastodon</a> —
retrieves links to Mastodon profiles from websites.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/virtulis/substitoot">Substitoot</a> —
loads replies to someone's Mastodon post if the server hasn't loaded
them itself.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://josh-berry.github.io/tab-stash/">Tab Stash</a> —
lets me to store my 9999+ open tabs, which I will be read later 😁, on
the stash.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en">Tree
Style Tab</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/MurzNN/tst-colored-tabs">TST Colored
Tabs</a> — nice, feature-rich and colored vertical tabs for Firefox and
it's forks.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin">uBlock
Origin</a> — Ad blocker.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://unhook.app/">Unhook</a> — removes various unwanted
things in the YouTube interface, such as Shorts, related videos section,
trending tab and so on. As a result, any YouTube page becomes visually
cleaner and more usable.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-resumer/">Video
Resumer</a> — this extension saves the current position on the opened
YouTube video and lets me to start from the same place after browser
restart.</li>
</ul>
<li>GIMP and <a href="https://rawtherapee.com/">RawTherapee</a> for photo
editing</li>
<li>
<a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> for file
synchronization</li>
<li>
<a href="https://hledger.org">hledger</a> + sed + awk + sqlite for
accounting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
And of course — <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>! I
don't see it as just a text editor. For me, Emacs is a software
emulated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine">Lisp
machine</a> with
a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html">Lisp
dialect</a>, designed for text editing.
</p>
<p>
Because it is a Lisp machine, there are many useful programs for it that I
use every day:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">Dired</a>
as a file manager.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html">Eshell</a>
as a shell interpreter.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/">EMMS</a> to listen
music.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/">Mu4e</a> as a mail
client. With <a href="https://github.com/rss2email/rss2email">rss2email</a>
script it becomes a RSS client too.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools">PDF tools</a> as a PDF
viewer.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/">Nov</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jumper047/fb2-reader">fb2-reader</a> to
read e-books.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Almost everywhere — in WM, in Emacs, in browser, etc — I'm using
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarized">Solarized Light</a>
theme. A lot of time in the past I was using different dark themes because
they look kinda cool and "hacker-style". But, I found what light symbols on
the dark background leds to the pain in my eyes. After I switched to the
light theme, I immediately found what it is extremely good for my eyes. Also
I found what common myths about light themes — that they are too bright and
it is impossible to use it in the dark — just a myths. When I discovered the
brightness control keys on the my display — using computer at the night is
no longer a problem.
<img alt="Emacs with a Solarized Light theme" style="height: 100%; width:
100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/emacs.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Almost everywhere I use the <a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/">DejaVu
fonts</a> — both Serif and Sans Serif and and monospaced version for code.
</p>
<p>
You can see my configuration in the
my <a href="https://codeberg.org/evgandr/dotfiles">dotfiles repository</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="android">Android</h4>
<p>
Besides Android is based on Linux it is not the free in the same sense. The
OS out of the box is bloated with unnecessary software whose main purpose is
to lure user's attention and money with unwanted popups, notifications and
shitty UI full of "dark patterns".
</p>
<p>
So, I use the custom LineageOS build and chose the user applications
carefully. Most of them are open source.
</p>
<p>
General purpose software:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Default caller
application: <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fossify.phone/">Fossify
Phone</a>. Default application for
contacts: <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fossify.contacts/">Fossify
Contacts</a>. These applications just manage my calls and contacts
locally, allow me to make simple backups of call logs and contact lists
and don't send my data to Google.
</li>
<li>
For
SMS: <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fossify.messages/">Fossify
SMS Messenger</a>. It allows me to make simple backups of my SMS and
doesn't distract me with notifications about new and unnecessary
features, about "secure" backup of my data to Google and so on.
Blacklisting the SMS based on the keywords is the killer feature that
allows me to block <b>a lot</b> of marketing messages if it's sender
uses the same number for valuable messages.<br>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.vincent_falzon.discreetlauncher/">Discreet
Launcher</a> as a default launcher. It is minimalistic and allows to
rename or hide certain applications from the screen.<br>
<img alt="Different screens of Discreet Launcher" style="height: 100%; width:
100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/discreet.jpg">
</li>
<li>
As a main application store I
use <a href="https://f-droid.org">F-Droid</a>. And <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/">Aurora
Store</a> — an unofficial client for Google Play, without silly
notifications about "let me scan all your applications for safe
experience".
</li>
<li>
Keyboard: <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/juloo.keyboard2/">Unexpected
Keyboard</a> — a simple and privacy-conscious keyboard that allows me to
type a lot of characters just by swiping the keys towards the corners.
<img alt="Latin and Cyrillic layouts of Unexpected Keyboard" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/unexpected_kbd.jpg">
</li>
<li>
Requirement for Mastodon client
Moshidon — <a href="https://ntfy.sh/">nfty</a> needed for un-Googled
notifications.
</li>
<li>
Requirement for bank app to receive pushes on the device, not a SMSes:
<a href="https://microg.org/">microG</a>.
</li>
<li>
To use necessary but untrusted applications, that obviously send my data
and geolocation to bad actors (for example: all Yandex applications,
Zoom client, food delivery and marketplaces applications) — I
use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/">Shelter</a>. It
allows me to install all these applications into the isolated "Work
profile" and freeze them completely and immediately after screen lock.
</li>
<li>
For password management I
use <a href="https://github.com/zeapo/Android-Password-Store#readme">Password
Manager</a> with
an <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain/">OpenKeychain</a>. All
<a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> files are synchronized
with the phone
using <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/">Syncthing</a>
</li>
<li>
To clean Android file system from empty folders, duplicate files and to
clean cache of some applications I
use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.darken.sdmse/">SD Maid
2/SE</a>.
</li>
<li>
For file management I
use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fossify.filemanager/">Fossify
File Manager</a><a></a>.
<img alt="Fossify File Manager main window" style="height: 25%; width:
25%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/file_manager.png">
</li>
<li>
To check the weather online I
use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.ominous.quickweather/">QuickWeather</a>.
<img alt="Quick Weather window with forecast" style="height: 25%; width: 25%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/quick_weather.jpg">
</li>
<li>
Finding the right music player was difficult. I'm used to organizing my
music by folders with MP3 files in them, not by tags. But a lot of open
source music players use tags as first class citizens.
In the end I found the
a <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/code.name.monkey.retromusic/">Retro
Music</a> player, which does what I want.
<img alt="List of music catalogs, opened in Retro Player" style="height:
50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/retro_player.png">
After a bit of simple configuration, the player's UI "forgets" about
tags and albums and just shows me a list of catalogs on the SD card with
a music files inside:
<img alt="Settings with disabled banners, suggestions and unwanted
library categories" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/retro_player_settings.png">
</li>
<li>
I use
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/deckers.thibault.aves.libre/">Aves
Libre</a> as my gallery application. It's just better than Google's
gallery because it doesn't spam me with popup windows about "secure
backup", new "features", "AI" and so on with almost every tap of the
screen.
<img alt="My photos, opened in Aves Libre gallery application" style="height: 25%; width: 25%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/aves.jpg">
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For notes I use two apps:
</p>

<li>
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.madlonkay.orgro/">Orgro</a>

<li>
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.omgodse.notally/">Notally</a>
for easy note-taking on the go.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Surfing the Web:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Currently I
use <a href="https://github.com/ironfox-oss/IronFox">IronFox</a> as web
browser. There is a fork of discontinued Mull browser.
</li>
<li>
But as my "default Web browser" I use
the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.trianguloy.urlchecker/">URLCheck</a>. It
is a simple and nice application that removes unnecessary parameters
inserted for user tracking, passes the redirects and checks the HTTP
codes that the server returns. The latter is very useful, as the random
IPs in my area are currently being randomly blocked.
<img alt="A link to www.heise.de, opened in URLCheck application" style="height: 25%; width: 25%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/url_check.jpg">
</li>
<li>
I
use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.joinmastodon.android.moshinda/">Moshidon</a>
as my social networking client. They recently fixed the login to
Pixelfed instances, so I can use one app for multiple Fediverse
accounts, as it should be.<br>
</li>
<li>
For online videos I
use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.polymorphicshade.tubular/">Tubular</a> —
it just works, gives me access to the YouTube and PeerTube videos, and
allows me to have the same experience as I have with the desktop browser
(built-in SponsorBlock, YouTube dislikes, etc).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For maps on the go, I was forced to use a local proprietary map application,
because support for local public transport routes and locations is almost
impossible to add to preferred open source applications at the moment.
Anyway, for <i>pedestrian navigation</i> I'm
using <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/">OsmAnd~</a>.
<img alt="OsmAnd main window" style="height: 25%; width: 25%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/osmand.jpg">
</p>
<p>
To edit the map on the go, I use the nice set of the next applications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.westnordost.streetcomplete/">StreetComplete</a> —
to quickly improve the map with the game experience.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/info.zverev.ilya.every_door/">Every
Door</a> — to fix information about local amenities.
<img alt="Every Door main window" style="height: 25%; width: 25%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/every_door.jpg">
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.blau.android/">Vespucci</a> —
to add missing ways, correct existing ways and edit specific tags for
the points on the go.

<h3 id="diy">DIY</h3>
<p>
For the most of the work not related to electronics I use the the small
workbench <a href="https://www.safe.ru/catalog/proizvodstvennaya-mebel/verstaki-master/">"Мастер"</a>
with metal tabletop from the
company <a href="https://www.safe.ru/">"Промет"</a>, installed in my living
room. This workbench is modular, so I add a shelf and a sliding drawer to it
to store my tools.
<img alt="Grey workbench with metal tabletop, shelf and sliding drawer" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/master_workbench.png">
</p>
<p>
On the top there is a 420x594 <a href="https://olfa.com/">OLFA</a> mat for
cutting leather into pieces.
</p>
<p>
For various locksmithing work I use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Locksmith's vice with an anvil:
<a href="https://delot.ru/catalog/3_udarnyy_instrument/39_tiski_nakovalni_strubtsiny/391_tiski_so_strubtsinnym_krepleniem/tiski_so_strubtsinnym_krepleniem_63mm/">ТССН-63</a>
from <a href="https://delot.ru/">"Дело Техники"</a>.
<img alt="Big and green locksmith's vise with an anvil" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/vise.png">
</li>
<li>Dremel 3000 rotary tool with a lot of accessories for milling,
polishing and cutting. Of course, I use non-original accessories because
they are cheaper and have a good quality as original parts.</li>
<li>Metal hacksaw.</li>
<li>
A few files from the USSR era and a set of new diamond-coated needle
files.
<img alt="Set of files and needle files" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/files.jpg">
</li>
<li>
Metal scissors.
<img alt="Metal scissors with orange and blue handles" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/metal_scissors.jpg">
</li>
<li>
Set of sandpapers and a polishing paste
(<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%93%D0%9E%D0%98">ГОИ
paste</a>).
</li>
<li>
The old clamps.
<img alt="Two old metal clamps" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/clamps.jpg">
</li>
<li>
Marking tools: the cairn and the metal scraper.
<img alt="The cairn and the metal scraper" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/marking_tools.jpg">
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="electronics">Electronics</h4>
<p>
The main tool is, of course, a Lukey 852D soldering station. I have been
using it for almost 16 years and it still works without any problems.
<img alt="Lukey 852D soldering station" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;
object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/lukey.png">
</p>
<p>
The only modification I made was to increase the depth of penetration of the
heating element into the tip of the soldering iron. This was achieved by
properly cutting two metal tubes that hold the tip to the heating
element. I've also added a paronite barrier between the metal clamping nut
and the handle for easier use of the soldering iron.
<img alt="Modified soldering iron" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/soldering_iron.jpg">
</p>
<p>
The main soldering iron tips that I use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bevel tip — I use it most of the time: to solder/remove details to/from
PCB, to solder wires and so on.
<img alt="Bevel tip" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/bevel_tip.jpg">
</li>
<li>
Needle tip — to solder <b>really small</b> details, close to 0.9 mm or
smaller.
<img alt="Needle tip" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/needle_tip.jpg">
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All tips are lead free due to special coating.
</p>
<p>
I have been using the Mastech HY3500D as my laboratory power source for
almost 10 years.
<img alt="Mastech HY3500D power source" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;
object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/mastech.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Over the years I've only had two problems with it:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The knobs started to rattle, especially the "voltage file tune" knob.
</li>
<li>
It is necessary to wait almost 5 minutes after turning on the power
source while it is warming up. Otherwise the voltage readings will be
unstable (during those 5 minutes).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For different measurements I use two devices:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The timeless classic: the UNI-T UT33C multimeter.
<img alt="Mastech HY3500D power source" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/ut33c.jpg">
I use it endless amount of time and it is still good.<br>
This multimeter has an important feature — it can measure temperature
with the attached thermocouple. I use this a lot to measure the
temperature of parts in some designs to check for overheating while
system is working.
</li>
<li>
To measure capacitance or inductance I use a Sinometer VC6243+. I don't
use it very often so I can't say anything about it — it just works.
<img alt="Sinometer VC6243+ meter" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/vc6243plus.jpg">
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course there are a lot of hand tools I use: tweezers, magnifiers,
snapping tools, (Philips) screwdrivers, Torx screwdrivers, scalpel, knife,
and so on...
<img alt="Tools for electronics DIY" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/electronics_tools.jpg">
</p>
<h4 id="leathercraft">Leathercraft</h4>
<p>
To mark the leather I use the shilo, the 20 cm metal ruler and the 40 cm
metal ruler, the old and heavy USSR-era calibration steel square. And the
metal compass (drawing tool).
</p>
<p>
To cut the leather I use only a trapezoid knife with interchangeable blades:
<img alt="Grey trapezoidal knife" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/knife.png">
</p>
<p>
To make <i>the holes</i> in the leather pieces, I have a set of
tools. First, there are a lot of cylindrical punches, which I use with a
special mallet with a nylon striker and with a special thick plastic sheet
that lies on top of the marble plate. With these tools I can precisely make
holes in difficult places.
<img alt="Set of classic punches" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/punches1.jpg">
</p>
<p>
I also have <i>special</i> punches to make holes for belt buckles, to shape
belt ends, to make holes for holster buttons, etc...
<img alt="Set of special punches" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/punches2.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Second, I use custom punches that connect to the button press. I bought
these from the local locksmith along with a custom plastic plate for the
press and the aluminum mat. With these punches I can make a lot of holes in
a straight line faster than with my bare hands.
<img alt="Set of punches for button press" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/punches3.jpg">
</p>
<p>
For sewing I use two simple tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li>My hands ;-)</li>
<li>
Needles from the company <a href="https://www.jjneedles.com/">"John
James"</a> for leathercrafting. They have an incredible quality — I
still use the same set of three needles for about 3 years and they are
still in perfect condition!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course there are: waxed threads, saddlery pony, tailor's scissors,
torzbil, letter stamps, slicker, poissons and bits and so on...
<img alt="Other leathercraft tools" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/leathercraft_tools.jpg">

<h3 id="note-taking">Note-taking</h3>
<p>
First of all, I use the good old paper and pen. When I'm thinking about new
project or problem, I usually take notes by hand. This action is very
pleasant with an incredible haptic feedback that is impossible to achieve
with glass touchscreens or with styluses.
</p>
<p>
The notebook and the pen don't need electricity or a charged battery to
work. And to make your notes indexable and searchable the humanity has
invented <b>a lot</b> of techniques till thousands of years.
</p>
<p>
To take notes, I use notebooks from local stores. I usually prefer notebooks
with dense, white and smooth sheets of paper. Also, the papers shouldn't
have any printed lines or cells — to draw different diagrams on it smoothly
without any inconveniences.
<img alt="Archive of my notebooks" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/notebooks.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Each scribbled notebook gets a sticky label with the year it started and the
year it ended. So on the photo above there are the notebooks from 2008 to
2023.
</p>
<p>
To write notes I'm using the
black <a href="https://www.kaweco-pen.com/schreibgeraete/fuellhalter/113/kaweco-al-sport-fuellhalter-black?c=49">Kaweco
AL Sport</a> fountain pen since 2014.
<img alt="Black Kaweco fountain pen, closed" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/kaweco1.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Before, as I a student without enough money, I tried to use cheap Parker
entry-level fountain pens made of plastic. They were usable, but of course
has a lot of disadvantages because of plastic.
</p>
<p>
So, a few years after that I decided to find cheap enough fountain pen that
is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Made of metal.</li>
<li>Don't use a plastic latch for the cap. The metal thread is
necessary.</li>
<li>Have a converter (reusable ink tank) in the accessories.</li>
<li>Not expensive, like a Parker pen, which meets the above
requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img alt="Black Kaweco fountain pen, opened" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/kaweco2.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Finally, I found the black Kaweco pen. It has been reliable enough over 10
years: there are just in a few spots where the anodizing has come off the
aluminum after I dropped the pen on the floor many times. The anodizing also
wore off on the threads and started to wear off where my fingers rested.
<img alt="Black Kaweco fountain pen cap" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/kaweco4.jpg">
</p>
<p>
The pen is easy to maintain: I just wash the nib part under water every six
months. And every 10 years or so, I grease the threads when it starts to
squeak when I unscrew it.
<img alt="Black Kaweco fountain pen nib" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover" src="/assets/images/uses/kaweco3.jpg">
</p>
<p>
I only use Parker black ink to fill the ink tank. They have proven itself to
be quite black and quick drying.
</p>
<br>
<p>
To take notes on the general purpose computers I use
the <a href="https://orgmode.org/">OrgMode</a> in Emacs. It is an incredible
tool with enough plugins (for Emacs of course) that allows me to stay in
touch with different timed events.
