<blockquote>
  <p>
    The "personal computer" was once a radical idea — a computer an
    individual could own and control completely. The concept emerged in the
    early 1970s when microprocessors made it economical and practical for a
    person to own their very own computer, in contrast to the rise of data
    processing mainframes in the 1950s and 60s.

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Hobby inflation is likely to register (and may already be registering)
    real social, political, and economic consequences&nbsp;— because not only
    are hobbies good for the well-being of those who take them up; they also
    connect people to their communities, help them make new friends, and bring
    them into contact with people whom, whether by virtue of age, race, or
    socioeconomic circumstance, they might otherwise have no occasion to
    know. If we are indeed living in "the anti-social century", as The
    Atlantic’s Derek Thompson has suggested, then the rising cost of hobbies
    could be part of the story of how many of us became more isolated.

    Inevitably, the economy has been bifurcating—you've heard of the "two
    economies." A "haves" economy for the rich and a "have-nots" economy for
    everyone else. For the have-nots, products, services, and opportunities
    are all getting worse, because there's no longer enough money in it to
    bother about.

  <p>
    One thing we noticed is that a lot of this history of computation was
    forgotten. There are no computation history classes in school. You can't
    expect people to always do the work of digging the ancestral past to learn
    how we got where we are now, but failing to do so creates myths. A lot of
    people think that ideas that died went away because they were bad, but
    it's almost never the case. When you start looking into these systems,
    it's always a social dynamic, or politics that made it so people forgot.

    "Why do you think the first person took one of these books off the shelf?"

    "I don't know, maybe they were looking to better understand the universe,
    to learn about history, or just to waste some time reading some fiction."
    I answered.

    "No, it was so they could make certain they could kill someone at a
    distance."

    Then I woke up. Um, dreams are silly like that…

    It seems I fell asleep in front of my terminal, waiting for the ARM
    architecture manual to open.
