summary: A nostalgic article about my first steps in Linux in Russian province at the beginning of the 21st century. Without access to the Internet.
---
#+END_EXPORT

At first, this article was going to be a grumbling about well-known ideas
like: "Let's add support for objects in Bash instead of /ObSoLeTe/ text and add
support for images and GIFs in the commands' output."

But as I was writing it, it turned out to be a nostalgic text about the
learning Linux in the province, in the early 2000s, without the Internet and
other things that are familiar to us now. And with a continuation in more
civilized places, with the obligatory red eyes from night coding, jumping
between Linux distributions and, ultimately, finding zen.

* How I came to Linux

It all started very prosaically — my grandparents bought me my first computer
and invited a friend, who was a programmer, to come over. He showed to me how
to use my first PC — and told me about another operating system called "Linux"
that was popular with programmers and hackers. This information was stored
somewhere in the back of my mind. Back then, I didn't have internet access,
except for a 56 kB/s modem at school, to which I could use every 1-2 weeks for
a few hours. So I couldn't download the Linux distribution to record it on a
CD, and I had no idea I could even download it from the Internet. I got the
Windows distribution from that programmer, and occasionally I'd rent other
discs. Usually, there were no Linux distributions there — only repacks of GTA,
Half-Life and other golden classics.

Back then, I was using Windows XP and spending a lot of time playing
Counter-Strike with bots and playing through various famous single-player
games. I already knew how to program in Pascal and I had the Turbo Pascal IDE
and compiler, which I copied to a floppy disk from the school computer. Of
course, I ran it in full-screen mode because it looked *cool*! Like in movies
about hackers, where people did some kind of magic by typing in
incomprehensible text.

[[file:IMG_2903.JPG]]

All this idyll would have continued, but a couple of years later I saw on the
shelf of a bookstore the book "Slackware/MOPSLinux for the user (with disk)".
Of course, I quickly and decisively persuaded my grandfather to buy it. Since
the computer was in my sole use, and I already knew how to reinstall Windows
and make backups (mods for CS 1.6 and my saves for GTA Vice City) — it was
time for some experiments! I had two CDs with Linux and Windows distributions,
seven hundred and fifty man pages, 150 sheets of a self-instruction book with
console commands and a lot of console utilities in =/bin= and =/usr/bin=, one 40
Gb hard drive, =Xorg -configure= which creates a non-working =/etc/X11/xorg.conf=,
and a text 80x25 console. Not that all is needed to become a cool hacker, but
once you start delving into the system internals, then follow your hobby to
the end. The only thing that bothered me was =fdisk=. There is nothing more
helpless, irresponsible and immoral in the world than a schoolchild using
=fdisk= to partition a hard drive. And I knew that pretty soon we would dive
into it.

#+ATTR_RST: :alt hacker meme :width 50% :align center
[[file:hacker_meme.jpeg]]

At first I just read the book and learn the console commands. After Windows,
it was *awesome* — you type some text, and the system /answers/ you, just like in
the movies. It doesn’t just draw an sandglass and it’s unclear what operating
system is doing. After some time, I learned how to exit vim, manually
configured the X server using man-pages and was able to install the Pascal
compiler, with which I continued to learn how to programming using the ITMO
University textbook. Then, I figured out how to compile programs from sources,
which I received on disks from the Xakep magazine (Russian transliteration of
the word "Hacker").

Of course, Windows XP still stayed in dual boot. The vast majority of the
software I used was for Windows. Support for DOC and XLS files in Linux was
bad in those days, and without GTA games I felt boring. And given the lack of
access to the Internet, I couldn’t figure out what else to do with Linux — KDE
+2+ 3 was installed, I tried all the programs from the MOPSLinux disk, read the
chapters about DNS and the HTTP servers from the book to the holes, but didn’t
see the point of using them on localhost without the Internet.

Looking back, I can say that the knowledge and skills I gained became the
*basis* that I still use today. It turns out that it is very useful to be alone
with Linux, when you only have access to a book, man pages and source codes
for the programs you want to install — there is no Internet or friends you can
ask. This allows you to learn a lot about the system and develop skills in
solving a variety of problems.x

Now, if some old, mammoth-shit, but very necessary legacy software refuses to
run, then that’s not my problem. I use =ldd=, make symlinks to the required
versions of libraries and read the logs to start the program anyway. If the
program crashes quietly, I'll use =strace=. If I hadn’t had these skills since
then, I can’t imagine how much time I would have spent at work and in pet
projects launching some not very "modern" and "right from the future"
software.

* Red-eyed period

Around 2007, I entered ITMO University and moved to St. Petersburg. This is
how I got access to huge (compared to what I had seen before) bookstores —
House of Books on Nevsky prospekt and DVK (House of Military Books), which was
neither a house, nor sells military books. Since by that time I had already
been indoctrinated by Xakep magazine — the following were swept off the
shelves:
- "[[https://bhv.ru/product/linux/][Linux in the original]]" from the publishing house BHV
- "Developing Applications in a Linux Environment" from Williams Publishing
  (the photo of the MOPSLinux disk above is in the background of pages from
  this book)
- K&R "The C Programming Language".

Since at that time I had the Internet via dial-up, by the cards[fn:cards], I
rarely used it. Mainly I check de.ifmo.ru portal for students and download
free as beer books from the Moshkov Library (Lib.Ru). When I tried to do
something longer, the time on the card ran out, my Acorp Sprinter@56K hung up
and I had to run to the post office again for a new card.

Therefore, again, as before, I sat with books, studied system calls, and wrote
all sorts of simple programs to learn programming.

Unlimited Internet, which is familiar to us in the modern sense, appeared to
me somewhere around 2009-2010 years. And then everything started to take off —
I tortured the hard drive of my computer, installing various distributions
there. Basically, I chose them according to the following principle: "Oh, what
a beautiful desktop environment is in this distribution — let’s install it
urgently!"

#+ATTR_RST: :alt change distro meme :width 50% :align center
[[file:change_distro.png]]

From that time I only have three screenshots left. Here I’m digging into the C
code in GVim, covered with plugins ([[http://fluxbox.org/][FluxBox]] window manager):

[[file:2010-05-21-223027_1280x800_scrot.png]]

And here is some code in GNU Assembler:

#+ATTR_RST: :alt asm code in vim :width 50% :align center
[[file:2010-05-21-233743_1280x800_scrot.png]]

At the same time, I mastered LaTeX, tired of problems with printing student
reports, when a file made in Open Office was printed crookedly in a bookstore
near the university. And so I could finally write the report text in vim and
get a beautiful PDF output that looks and prints the same /everywhere/.

Well, I continued to master system programming. One of the first programs I
wrote is still in the SVN repository on SourceForge. This is jabsh
(https://sourceforge.net/p/jabsh/code/HEAD/tree/) — something like a jabber
remote shell. I didn’t have the opportunity to get a static IP address at that
time, but I wanted to do something on my computer remotely. At that time, I
had a Siemens C75 with the Bombus Jabber client installed, in which I chatted
in all sorts of Linux conferences on jabber.ru when I didn’t have a computer
at hand. And then the idea came to me to write a daemon that would connect to
the Jabber server, wait for console commands from me, execute them and send
the execution result in a return message.

This thing even worked and I used it until I got a static IP address. I even
had a user from India for whom jabsh for some reasons did not work, and we
send e-mails to each other for some time about this.

Another one of the programs from those times is a summer project from my
future scientific supervisor — [[https://github.com/eugeneandrienko/termprogs][termprogs]], for managing a set of "terminals"
through "workstations", with a central server where the whole things are
connected.

#+ATTR_RST: :alt termprogs scheme :width 50% :align center
[[file:system_scheme.png]]

Just at this point, I was finishing reading William Stevens’ book "UNIX:
Network Application Development" and could put all my system programming
knowledge into practice.

* Regexp 101 in ITMO University

Somewhere in my 2nd or 3rd year at the university, I started taking
classes[fn:bologna_process] on system programming. At first we were taught to
use the terminal and vim on thin clients from Sun Microsystems, with
pot-bellied CRT monitors. During these classes, I do nothing for a whole
semester — after all, I had already studied all this back in school. But then
the fun began.

We spent half the semester studying regular expressions and the =grep=, =sed= and
=awk=. But regular expressions passed me by and I used =grep= at the level: "well,
if you pass it a string as a parameter, it will search for matches in the
file".

And here are furious tasks, kilometers of regexps and all that jazz. By the
end of the semester, regular expressions were falling off my teeth. Looking
back, I can now say that this regexp course is another *unshakable pillar* that
I still use constantly. I can’t imagine how much time and efforts my knowledge
of regular expressions saved me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I still don’t understand where idea "if you solving a problem and decide to
use regular expressions, then now you have two problems" came from. My
experience at work and at home shows that if you need to somehow cleverly
parse a string using a regular expression, then you take =sed= or Java's =Pattern=
and =Matcher= — and parse the string. Then you test the resulting code, send it
to testers — and then it just works for years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the same time, I began to share my experience — write articles on
[[https://welinux.ru][welinux.ru]], talking with other people on [[https://linuxforum.ru][linuxforum.ru]], and attend SPbLUG
meetings. At one time I had a blog on WordPress, which I set up on some free
VPS, which you could use as long as you did not go beyond the lower or upper
limits on CPU and memory. That’s when I became addicted to writing all sorts
of texts with amazing stories.

* Linux and embedded-programming

Around 2011, I made a fateful decision — to go into embedded programming. At
that time, this area of ​​Computer Engineering seemed to me more interesting and
romantic than "regular" programming. After all, there are no "simplifying"
levels of abstraction here —you take and write code that works directly on the
hardware! And then you debug the whole thing using blinking LEDs, debug
printing via UART, an oscilloscope and other tools. And all the knowledge
about bits, bytes, the internal structure of all kinds of EEPROM, SRAM and
other things is used 24/7!

All relevant courses at the university included working with Windows — at that
time the necessary development environments and compilers were mainly for this
operating system. But, naturally, this did not stop me. For half of the
software I used VirtualBox with Windows inside. For the second half, I was
able to find the necessary native tools.

For training, we initially used special devices based on the MCS-51 family
microcontroller. If the code for them could be written in anything — I used
Vim/Emacs — then compiling and flashing the compiled binary into the device
was more complicated. For compilation, I used =sdcc=, but for firmware, a
special utility was needed — and =m3p=. It was written by one of the university
professors in ancient times on the C language. Fortunately, this utility was
written with cross-platform compatibility in mind, therefore, after a couple
of minor edits in the source code, it calmly did its job under Linux.

In those days, having begun to get tired of all sorts of "modern"
distributions, with their NetworkManagers, +PsshPsshAudio+ PulseAudio, Avahi
Daemon and other "innovations" were breaking my user experience, developed
back in the days of Slackware — I came to Arch Linux. It was possible to
quickly install a basic system without the programs described above,
supplement it with only the software I needed, and calmly work and watch
memes.

Then I already began to develop a certain set of software, which I constantly
used. By an understandable coincidence ("Russian" Slackware as the first Linux
distribution and my love to use the console like a "hacker") it was mainly
console software:

- =vim/emacs= — for editing text and code.
- =latex= — for writing all sorts of complex documents, especially if they need
  to be printed or sent somewhere. Well, for drawing presentations, so as not
  to "get up twice".
- Some kind of tiling WM — anyway, after a month of using some beautiful KDE
  or GNOME, I came to the conclusion that by default all my windows were
  expanded to full screen and scattered across the desktops, depending on the
  window name. And since you can’t see the difference, then why waste disk
  space on a heavy DE, if I can get everything I need in some xmonad or i3wm?
  Although, all sorts of beauty in the form of shadows, animations and
  transparency, which DE gives me, please the eyes for the first couple of
  weeks, but then the "wow effect" is expectedly lost.
- Well, and all sorts of other console utilities with which I could work with
  or without consciousness: =grep=, =sed=, =git=, =make=, =cron= and so on.

Since then, I had a [[https://github.com/eugeneandrienko/dotfiles][repository with dotfiles]], in which I dragged my
configuration files for the above-described programs from system to system.

Here are some desktop screenshots from those days. Here is xmonad on two
monitors - urxvt on the left, Chromium on the right:

And here the editing of the student's report. On the left is the final

After that, I tried many times to switch to a /usual/ software with a GUI or to
all kinds of Web applications, but it just didn't work for me anymore. There
weren't many ways to customize it for yourself. Some configuration options
were extremly limited. Or software wasn't as fast as I'd desired. Or it was
just inconvenient — the startup focus wasn't where I'm used to seeing it, or
the main window displays information I wasn't used to seeing, and so on.

The final straw was the "redesign" of GMail. It slowed down even more and
required more RAM than before. At this point I switched to mutt. Luckily, this
thing is not the subject to the /mOsT mOdErN dEsIgN/ trends and its appearance
doesn't change from year to year. It works pretty quickly, alas, it launches
not so quickly, even with caching. This is because I've had all my emails in
maildirs since 2009 (about 47 thousand emails).

But the main thing with mutt is that it won't change in one "fine" day at the
request of the left heel of the someone in the design department at Google.

[[file:two_types_of_linux_users.jpg]]


In general, I've come to see Linux as more of a practical tool than a
something "religious". There's no longer the same level of passion around
which people wage wars over which Linux distribution is best. It started to
become just a convenient and familiar operating system for me, one I only
needed a little of:
- Do not do anything critical, such as software updates, without my knowledge.
- Just execut ethe programs, which are familiar to me.
- Stick to FHS[fn:fhs] and other standard things that I have learned since the
  days of Slackware — so that if some problem /suddenly/ arises, I can quickly
  and calmly figure it out, understanding what is going on in the system.
- Do not impose on me a way to store *my files* — everything should be sorted
  into directories in the way that is convenient for me, without any tags or
  stars with the file rating. Or predefined directories.

* Linux and the job

At my first job, we used Windows 7 as the operating system for our office
computers, which were used for embedded programming. When we needed Linux, we
used Linux Mint, which worked great — no problems at all. I also maintained
the servers, which ran some kind of RHEL. These tasks helped me become skilled
at digging in internals of Web servers, database servers, and also in
iptables, rsync and bash scripts.

At the time, I also had Linux Mint installed at home. I was generally
indifferent to which Linux distribution I used. Anyway, I install the system
in a minimal "console" configuration and then install the rest of the software
I needed, according to the list from my repository with dotfiles. It seems
like an ideal setup, doesn't it?

But then something strange started happening with Linux. Git renamed the
branch =master= to =main=, not for technical reasons, but because of some
political issues related to a single and distant country on the other side of
the globe. Luckily, I was able to avoid this unnecessary change, thanks to the
flexibility of the console software:
#+begin_src
  [init]
    defaultbranch = master
#+end_src

Then it became popular to replace the usual utilities like =grep= or =ls= with
their equivalents, which either print beautiful color output or work faster
(but on the volumes of data that I usually use, this did not speed things up
enough). I tried them out for a while, but I ended up going back to the usual
tools from coreutils. I didn't want to install into my system another supercat
that can highlight the source code in the output, but however, it is not in
the distribution repositories. So I need to go to GitHub and install it by
hand.

If I need the source code highlighted, I'll just open the file in a text
editor. Let =cat= simply print the contents of the file to stdout, as it has
done for decades!

Then, for some reason, developers started replacing =ifconfig= with =iproute2=. I
heard, what it was because of the need to work with IPv6. But in FreeBSD, as
far as I know, they simply added the necessary functionality to =ifconfig= and
people continue to use familiar and time-tested utility 🤷‍♂️.

The last straw for me was when they installed systemd everywhere instead of
System-V init or BSD-style init. I didn't like the way that non-alternative
pused systemd into Debian, and through it into the Linux Mint, which is what I
use. For about ten years now, it's been ingrained in me that at startup the
system launches ordinary shell scripts from =/etc/init.d/= or =/etc/rc.d/=. I can
run them directly from the console or even edit them in any way I like to
understand why some tao-cosnaming or other daemon does not work the way I
want. And here we have something alienish thing, to which even the binary
registry has not yet been attached. The binary startup logs that can't be
viewed through =less= are already there. Plus, the unit files doesn't offer the
same flexibility as shell scripts. Plus, systemd diligently replacing all the
individual programs that were familiar to me, which always just did their job
and didn’t bother me over decades: =grub=, =cron=, =agetty= and so on.

At that moment (/after/, but not /as a result/) I left my job in embedded
programming and went for a higher salary to the Java-enterprise, with
bytecode, shell scripts, and a lot of ​​regexes — everything I love.

Well, trying to avoid systemd’s attack on my habits, I left Linux Mint for
Gentoo.

#+ATTR_RST: alt: gentoo meme width: 50% align: center
[[file:gentoo.jpeg]]

I picked it because at the time, it was one of the few distributions that
didn't use systemd. Instead, it had its own initialization system (OpenRC),
which is very, very similar to the System V initialization system.

I wrote in =/etc/portage/make.conf= the next line:
#+begin_src
  USE="-systemd unicode -pulseaudio X alsa"
#+end_src

I haven’t experienced any grief since then. This system has been rock-solid
for 5 years and it's still going strong. It has easily survived the kernel
update from 4.19.23 to 6.1.57, and it just works. I run the update once a
month, if I don’t forget, and that’s it. I think the reason it's so stable is
that I use the really simple (like a digging stick) software, created in
immemorial times. It doesn't have any "innovations" and it doesn't support
simultaneous audio output to a 7.1 system, Bluetooth headphones in the next
room, and over the network to tablet. Naturally, if everything is designed
simply and clearly, then it won't break. There were only two times something
broke after the update.

One day, the Midnight Commander developers renamed the configuration file
=mc.ext= to =mc.ext.ini=, to make it consistent with the names of other
configuration files. And I had to rename it myself.

The second issue I came across was that the person maintaining the binary
package for Firefox forgot to link it with the libraries for ALSA[fn:alsa].
As a result, there was no sound in the browser. I rolled back to the previous
version of Firefox, went to the Gentoo bug tracker to create a new bug, but it
was already there and people were actively commenting on it. A few more days
later the package was put back together correctly and that was that.

* What I expected and what I got

#+ATTR_RST: :align center :alt desktop screenshot
[[file:2024-01-02-032653_3200x1080_scrot.png]]
/Audacious on the left/

It's evident that I'm not quite at the level of a "cool Linux hacker,
committing patches to the kernel instead of breakfast, lunch and dinner"
(yet). But all those years of tinkering with console utilities paid off. I
ended up with a pretty stable and simple system that I can use event without
consciousness. In this system no one app will change it's interface by itself
according to "new fashion trends".

In this system all my settings are stored in Git, so nothing will change
without my knowledge. I can do whatever I want with just a couple of lines in
the desired file and a several basic commands combined via pipe, for example:

- The plain-text accounting utility didn't allow me to use the "cash envelope"
  system I was used to. I used dialog, awk and sqlite3
  [[https://eugene-andrienko.com/en/it/2023/12/20/plain-text-accounting][to
  create a budgeting system on top of hledger]] that does everything I need.

- I bought myself a Logitech Trackman Marble trackball, which has the
  "Forward" and "Back" buttons I don’t need. But there is no middle mouse
  button or scroll. And this is not a problem.

  I create a file =/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50trackball.conf= with the following
  lines:
  #+begin_src
    Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "Marble Mouse"
        MatchProduct "Logitech USB Trackball"
        Option "EmulateWheel" "true"
        Option "EmulateWheelButton" "9"
        Option "MiddleEmulation" "true"
        Option "ButtonMapping" "3 8 1 4 5 6 7 2 9"
        Option "XAxisMapping"  "6 7"
    EndSection
  #+end_src

  The "Back" button now works like the middle mouse button, and if hold down
  the "Forward" button, I can scroll the text in all directions with the
  ball. As I'd wanted, the trackball is now left-handed.

- The new keyboard has Fn buttons for "My Computer", "Search", and "Browser",
  but no buttons for volume control? No problem! I use =xmodmap= to reassign the
  button codes in the file it generates:
  #+begin_src
    keycode 152 = XF86AudioLowerVolume NoSymbol XF86AudioLowerVolume
    keycode 163 = XF86AudioRaiseVolume NoSymbol XF86AudioRaiseVolume
    keycode 180 = XF86AudioMute NoSymbol XF86AudioMute
  #+end_src

So, for me, Linux is now just a system that runs the programs I'm used to —
which, like a wall made of bricks, form my familiar user environment. The
bastions — represented by Gentoo and Devuan[fn:devuan] — are currently
protecting me from the overwhelming ​​changes that aren't necessary for me and
related problems. While the rest of the Linux world is changing the
initialization systems, moving away from the X server and rewriting coreutils
in Rust, I'm still using the same tools I've always used. I'm just easily read
email and RSS feeds in mutt year after year.

When (if) these bastions fall, I’ll probably move +to the monastery+ to
FreeBSD. Luckily, I've already got some experience using it as a regular
user. All my other software, like i3wm, emacs, Firefox, RawTherapee and so on,
also works there. The only big changes in my configuration that will have to
be made are to call =gmake= instead of =make= in some Makefiles, and to use more
correct she-bang =#!/usr/bin/env bash= in scripts, instead of the usual
=#!/bin/bash=. Unfortunately, I'll have to say goodbye to Docker, which isn't
available on FreeBSD, and the ability to work with LUKS crypto-containers. But
it’s better to lose them than all my familiar, configured with love
environment and my long-term habits.

My entire history of mastering Linux can be described as "hard to learn, hard
to master". But over time, I developed all kinds of different habits that let
me write texts, use the internet, and so on — literally "at my
fingertips". That's why I’m not here advocating you immediately switch to i3wm
or Emacs for the sake of /pRoDuCtIvItY/. Without the habits I've mentioned, it
won't help. First of all, you have to want to learn, for example, Emacs, and
be prepared for the fact that you will have to configure it for some time, and
not perceive this time as "well, I need to set up a text editor instead of
just opening it and writing text" — and then something will work out. I think
all these articles about switching to Vim to be more productive in programming
are misleading. Firstly, you'll spend time on vimtutor instead of
programming. Secondly, there's not a strong connection between typing speed
and programming. I can type at a speed of only 60-70 characters per minute,
but this doesn't affect my productivity as a programmer. After all, I'm typing
code on the keyboard at most 20-25% of the time. About 10-15% of the time is
spent communicating with colleagues and on Zoom calls to figure out what's
going on with this task or bug. The other 60-70% is spent reflecting in front
of a notebook with a pen in hand, thinking: "how can I make a change correctly
and quickly, so I don't waste a lot of time, either now or in the future?"
So, vim won’t help with productivity here — it doesn't think for me in front
of a piece of paper.

Third, let's be real. Right now, for a lot of languages, a big, complex IDE is
still a better choice than Vim or Emacs. Even if you have an LSP
server[fn:lsp] for your editor. For instance, Emacs' LSP for Java still
doesn't work very well — it crashes on simple things, it doesn't update the
context of changes in files as quickly as IDEA does, and requires some finesse
to make it work with Lombok.

As a general rule, you can get a lot done in the GUI and it's the best place
for it. It's best to develop photographs in RawTherapee, edit images in GIMP,
view the site in Firefox, and so on. But there are lots of other actions you
can do right from the console. It's just matter of convenience. Some people
find it easier to select files to copy with the mouse in Nautilus, while
others prefer to use the =cp ~/photos/{photo,video}_*.{jpeg,jpg,JPG,avi}
/media/BACKUP=. It's great that Linux (for now) offers a choice for both people
who are used to a graphical interface and for those who prefer to communicate
with the machine by text.

* Notes

[fn:cards] In Russia, you could buy a special card with a code and other
credentials to connect to the Internet at the /street kiosk/ or at the post
office. These credentials were used to connect to the Internet via a dialup
modem. As a rule, one card allows access to the Internet for a few hours (two
or three, if I remember correctly).
[fn:bologna_process] I didn't just "started taking classes" of course. The
Russian implementation of the Bologna process didn't give students as much

«Philosophy» and «Ethics» (or «Rhetorics», I don't remember).

with an Intel Core i7 can cause the CPU to overheat.
